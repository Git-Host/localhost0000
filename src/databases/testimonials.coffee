    comment: "Komodo Edit helps the Icinga development in not only C and C++ programming, but also native script languages such as Perl or PHP. Compared to other cross-platform IDEs it's fast, responsive and and  offers a huge set of configuration and customization capabilities. Especially when working with a large number of files and directory structures as we do in Icinga."

But all of the developers help me on the forum by providing a support and answering my questions."

Komodo IDE syntax highlights and auto-completes my Perl, Ruby, XML, SQL, HTML and CSS, allowing my team to write better code more quickly than we ever have."

    comment: "Capable of running just as powerfully on the Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows platforms, Komodo is the best IDE I've used to write Perl, Python, Ruby and Web applications. And because it looks and performs identically on these operating systems and languages, I feel instantly at home and productive regardless of what OS I'm running it on."
