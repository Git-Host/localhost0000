After weeks of hard work we can finally present to you our new web site! It's
been a long time coming and although a lot of work has been done thus far a lot
more is still to come. We're working hard not just on Komodo but also on the
infrastructure surrounding Komodo: community, addons, support, documentation, etc.

## The New Website

</a>

When we started work on the new website we knew we wanted to do something different.
Although full-fledged CMSes like [Drupal] certainly have their strength they also
take away a certain amount of flexibility. After a period of evaluation we ultimately
decided that for the purposes of our Komodo website a static site generator would
give us the flexibility we desired and give incredible performance to boot. And
to that end we decided [DocPad] would be the best fit for us.

So why [DocPad]? Why not [Jekyll] or one of the huge variety of other [static site generators][generators]
out there? Well first off I don't want to undersell the "competition", they all
bring their own unique twist to the table, but Komodo being largely written in
JavaScript we liked the idea of a [NodeJS] powered static site generator. Aside from
that simple fact; [Benjamin Lupton][balupton], the creator of [DocPad], has done an amazing job
in making [DocPad] an incredibly versatile tool that can be easily modeled to ones
preferences. Prefer to use [ResText] rather than [Markdown] for your blogs? [No problem][restextPlugin]!
Need to have some [PHP], [Ruby], [CoffeeScript] etc. in your pages? Go for it! It truly is an
amazing tool and so far it's been a lot of fun to use.

### Thank You!

Before I move on to the contest, I'd like to thank [Benjamin Arthur (balupton)][balupton] not only
for his amazing work on [DocPad] but also for assisting us with some occasional issues
via [IRC]. Thanks Benjamin! Furthermore I'd also like to thank everyone that contributed
to DocPad since it's inception -- Thank you!

## Let's Celebrate - Win a Copy of Komodo!

To celebrate the launch of the new website we're giving away 2 copies of Komodo IDE.
There are 2 ways to win a copy, the simple way (but less chance of winning) or
the "fan" way (your chances are in our hands). Or, you know, do both!

### The Simple Way

Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/">@KomodoIDE</a> on Twitter and retweet:

<div class="centered">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Win a copy of my fave IDE: Komodo! Just follow <a href="https://twitter.com/komodoide">@KomodoIDE</a> &amp; Retweet <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23KomodoContest&amp;src=hash">#KomodoContest</a> <a href="http://t.co/0R6UmCTn20">http://t.co/0R6UmCTn20</a></p>&mdash; Komodo IDE &amp; Edit (@komodoide) <a href="https://twitter.com/komodoide/statuses/413407251773550592">December 18, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div>

Doesn't get any simpler! But that's what everyone will be doing, so maybe you should try ..

### The Fan Way

Tweet a screenshot that shows off your Komodo setup and and use the hashtag
#KomodoContestFeb2014. The reason we say "your chances are in your hands"
is because we will pick our favourite submission ourselves, so **the more you
stand out - the bigger the chances you'll win!**
