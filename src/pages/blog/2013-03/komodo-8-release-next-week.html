          <p><img alt="" src="/images/blog/2013-03/komodo-dragon.png" style="width: 230px; height: 138px;">Komodo 8.0 is set to release on Thursday, March 7, and to say we're excited is a huge understatement.</p>
  <p>Every Komodo release is a big deal, but this one's really going to be a killer. With a totally refreshed UI and major updates to editing and workflow, 8.0 promises to deliver an incredible user experience.</p>
  <p><strong>Note: Anyone who has purchased Komodo IDE on or after Feb. 7, 2013...</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Don't worry! You will automatically receive an upgrade to Komodo IDE 8.0.</strong></p>
  <p>Here is what you can expect from Komodo 8.0:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <strong>New User Interface</strong>: Lean, clean UI hides features you don't use and feels native to each OS.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <strong>Floating Side Panes</strong>: Lots of user requests for this. Finally, undock side panes and move them around to anywhere on screen or on a separate monitor.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <strong>Auto Abbreviations</strong>: Type the first few characters to automatically trigger snippet selection.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <strong>Open Files Side Pane</strong>: Organize all your open files by language.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <strong>Conditional Snippets</strong>: Use JavaScript to programatically determine snippet contents at runtime.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <strong>Mini-Map</strong>: Lots of user requests for this too. Mouse and reposition anywhere on a high-level view of your code.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Retina support for Mac OS X!</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>There's more. A lot more</strong>. Check out <a href="/framed#http://activestate.com/blog/2013/02/komodo-8-beta-available">Todd's blog post</a> for a more detailed rundown, and <a href="/framed#http://activestate.com/blog/2013/02/komodo-8-user-interface">Nathan's blog post</a> on the new UI -- the post itself is an example of jquery magic.</p>
  <p>Thanks to all beta users for your participation and feedback so far. If you haven't previewed Komodo 8.0 yet, there's still time to do so. Download Komodo 8.0.0c1 at: <a href="/framed#http://activestate.com/komodo-ide/downloads">http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide/downloads</a></p>
