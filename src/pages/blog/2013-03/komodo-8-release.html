  <p>We had a feeling that this release would go over well. Komodo 8.0 has a lot of major features and revisions that our users have been requesting for a very long time. I'm proud to say that we've delivered, and that you'll really like what we've come up with.</p>
  <h3>What's New in 8.0</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <strong>User Interface Styling</strong>: Redesigned to be lighter and feel native for each platform</li>
  <li>
  <strong>Floating Side Panes</strong>: Undock components and move them anywhere on screen</li>
  <li>
  <strong>Open Files Side Pane</strong>: Organizes all your open files by language</li>
  <li>
  <strong>Minimap</strong>: Reposition anywhere from a high-level view</li>
  <li>
  <strong>Fast Open Shortcuts</strong>: Create shortcuts to long file and directory paths</li>
  <li>
  <strong>Auto Abbreviations</strong>: You can now type abbreviations to trigger a selection of snippets</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What We Wanted to Achieve</h3>
  <p>There were two aspects of Komodo that we really wanted to sink our teeth into, excuse the pun.</p>
  <p>First, we had always wanted to make changes to the user interface. While we have kept adding new functionality and components to Komodo over the years, the UI had grown a bit unweildy. It was time to streamline it, and also make it feel more consistent with each user's operating system.</p>
  <p>Secondly, we wanted to make it as quick and easy to navigate code as possible. Komodo has always been known as a fast IDE, but we could always do better. With that goal in mind, we designed the <a href="http://activestate.com/sites/default/files/komodo8/ss/new/openfiles.png" target="_blank">Open Files Side Pane</a>, <a href="http://activestate.com/sites/default/files/komodo8/ss/new/fastopen-shortcut.png" target="_blank">Fast Open Shortcuts</a> and the high-level <a href="http://activestate.com/sites/default/files/komodo8/ss/new/minimap.png" target="_blank">Minimap</a> scroll area.</p>
  <p>Overall, we've found the right balance of new and classic. Current and past users will be pleased that it still codes like Komodo but feels more flexible and efficient than before.</p>
  <h3>Promotional Pricing</h3>
  <p>At the expense of sounding like a marketing person (and a poor one at that), Komodo IDE is on sale now until March 31.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <strong><font color="red">$245</font></strong> for new licenses (regular price $295)</li>
  <li>
  <strong><font color="red">$136</font></strong> to upgrade from version 7 (regular price $168)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I do recommend adding an annual Upgrades and Support subscription for these reasons:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>It's only $87 annually to keep current with the latest release (instead of the $136 upgrade).</li>
  <li>You'll get priority support from our friendly ActiveState folks.</li>
  <li>If you're upgrading from version 7, there is a bigger discount when you add the Upgrades &amp; Support option (basically comes to $69 this year instead of $87).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To buy a new license, <a href="http://store.activestate.com" target="_blank">visit our store</a>. To upgrade, sign in to your <a href="https://account.activestate.com/" target="_blank">"My Account" page</a>.</p>
  <p>But enough of that.</p>

  <p>Cheers!</p>
