Today we selected our first contest winner! In case you wheren't keeping track -
we're [having a contest][Contest] in which you can win a copy of Komodo simply by showing
off your Komodo setup! Note that we will be giving away another copy of Komodo
to our favourite participant in 2 weeks! So send in your entries!

So, who won the first copy? You may congratulate [Ron Stewart]! He submitted the
following tweet -

<div class="centered">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/komodoide">@komodoide</a> My Komodo Edit: <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Base16&amp;src=hash">#Base16</a>  scheme, Open Files, split view, minimap, ToDo, komodo-cfml  <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23KomodoIDEdotCom&amp;src=hash">#KomodoIDEdotCom</a> <a href="http://t.co/GE3HY3hbo2">pic.twitter.com/GE3HY3hbo2</a></p>&mdash; Ron Stewart (@oneofwe3geeks) <a href="https://twitter.com/oneofwe3geeks/statuses/437277651917471744">February 22, 2014</a></blockquote>

Why did this win him the contest? Well he was one of the few people that actually
showed some advanced usage of Komodo. In his screenshot he is using the following
features:

 * The [Open Files Widget]
 * Split View
 * The [TODO Helper Addon]
 * The [Komodo CFML Addon] - Written by [Ron Stewart] himself!
 * A custom Base 16 color scheme *(which we hope he will share!)*

All of this added up to it being our favourite entry in the contest so far. We
hope you enjoy your Komodo IDE license Ron!
