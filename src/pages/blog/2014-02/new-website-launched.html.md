After weeks of hard work we can finally present to you our new web site! It's
been a long time coming and although a lot of work has been done thus far a lot
more is still to come. We're working hard not just on Komodo but also on the
infrastructure surrounding Komodo: community, addons, support, documentation, etc.

## The New Website

</a>

When we started work on the new website we knew we wanted to do something different.
Although full-fledged CMSes like [Drupal] certainly have their strength they also
take away a certain amount of flexibility. After a period of evaluation we ultimately
decided that for the purposes of our Komodo website a static site generator would
give us the flexibility we desired and give incredible performance to boot. And
to that end we decided [DocPad] would be the best fit for us.

So why [DocPad]? Why not [Jekyll] or one of the huge variety of other [static site generators][generators]
out there? Well first off I don't want to undersell the "competition", they all
bring their own unique twist to the table, but since the Komodo code base uses
a lot of JavaScript we liked the idea of a [NodeJS] powered static site generator. Aside from
that simple fact; [Benjamin Lupton][balupton], the creator of [DocPad], has done an amazing job
in making [DocPad] an incredibly versatile tool that can be easily modeled to ones
preferences. Prefer to use [ResText] rather than [Markdown] for your blogs? [No problem][restextPlugin]!
Need to have some [PHP], [Ruby], [CoffeeScript] etc. in your pages? Go for it! It truly is an
amazing tool and so far it's been a lot of fun to use.

### There Be Dragons (pun intended)

A big new website doesn't come without it's problems, and so there are sure to be
some minor issues here and there. If you run into any and don't mind sparing a few
minutes of your time, please [report them on github][report].

### Acknowledgements

Before I move on to the contest, I'd like to thank [Benjamin Arthur (balupton)][balupton] not only
for his amazing work on [DocPad] but also for assisting us with some occasional issues
via [IRC]. Furthermore I'd also like to thank everyone that contributed
to DocPad since it's inception -- Thank you!

## Let's Celebrate - Win a Copy of Komodo!

To celebrate the launch of the new website we're giving away 3 copies of Komodo IDE.
There are 2 ways to win a copy, the simple way (but less chance of winning) or
the "fan" way (your chances are in our hands). Or, you know, do both!

### The Simple Way (Read on to increase your chances)

Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/KomodoIDE">@KomodoIDE</a> on Twitter and retweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Win a copy of Komodo! Follow &amp; Retweet <a href="https://twitter.com/komodoide">@KomodoIDE</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23KomodoIDEdotCom&amp;src=hash">#KomodoIDEdotCom</a> or increase your chances by .. <a href="http://t.co/tJawubNKVK">http://t.co/tJawubNKVK</a></p>&mdash; Komodo IDE &amp; Edit (@komodoide) <a href="https://twitter.com/komodoide/statuses/436246722856378369">February 19, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We will give away one copy of Komodo to the participant who wins in the random draw.

Doesn't get any simpler! But that's what everyone will be doing, so maybe you should try ..

### The Fan Way (Screenshot your setup to us)

Tweet a screenshot that shows off your Komodo setup and use the hashtag
\#KomodoIDEdotCom. The reason we say "your chances are in your hands"
is because we will pick our favourite submissions ourselves, so **the more you
stand out - the bigger the chances you'll win!**

We will give away 2 copies of Komodo to our favourite submissions!

### Period

We will give away one license every week for 3 weeks, starting on Feb 28th and
every Friday from then on.
