It offers groundbreaking new technologies and innovative enhancements. Here's an introduction to the most prominent features it includes.</p>
  
  <ul style="clear:both">
  <li>
      <p><strong><a href="http://activestate.com/komodo-ide/features#collaboration" title="Code Collaboration">Code Collaboration</a></strong> is one of the coolest things to use in a team development environment. You can easily share your files and collaborate in real time with your colleagues and friends. Peer reviews and pair programming become a much more intuitive and interactive experience with Komodo's collaboration tools.</p>

    <img title="Komodo Sync" alt="Komodo Sync" style="width: 120px; float:right;" src="/images/blog/2012-02/ko7-sync.png" class="as_feature_img as_right"><p>For those that use multiple machines, Komodo's <strong><a href="http://activestate.com/komodo-ide/features#sync" title="Komodo Sync">Synchronization</a></strong> feature gives you the ability to copy your Komodo settings (remote server accounts, toolbox, file templates...) between all the Komodo instances. So you can customize Komodo in one place and have the same setup appear in another!</p>
    </li>
      
      
    <li style="clear:both">
      <p>The <strong><em>cloud</em></strong> is a new and exciting playground for developers. Komodo's <strong><a href="http://activestate.com/komodo-ide/features#stackato" title="Stackato Integration">Stackato</a></strong> interface provides the ability to quickly deploy web based applications onto cloud infrastructure - you can have your application running on the cloud within minutes! A slew of languages and frameworks are supported - such as <em>Python</em>, <em>Django</em>, <em>Ruby</em>, <em>Rails</em>, <em>PHP</em>, <em>Drupal</em>, <em>Perl</em>, <em>Mojolicious</em>, <em>Node.js</em> and even <em>Java</em>!</p>

    <li style="clear:both">
      <p><a href="http://activestate.com/komodo-ide/features#node.js" title="Node.js support"><strong>Node.js support</strong></a> - Komodo IDE brings in debugging, code intelligence, editor and syntax checking support for Node applications. As well as this, Komodo IDE 7 provides additional support for web and template languages like <em>CoffeeScript</em>, <em>LESS</em>, <em>SCSS</em>, <em>EJS</em> and <em>Mojolicious</em>.</p>

      <p style="clear:both">With the ability to <strong><a href="http://activestate.com/komodo-ide/features#profiling" title="Code Profiling for PHP and Python">Code Profile</a></strong> your application - you can now find out why that <em>PHP</em> or <em>Python</em> code is taking so long to run! Komodo shows a graphical representation of the methods and calls made by your program, as well as outlining the CPU time spent executing your code. Automatic time sorting makes it easy to see the code hot-spots at a single glance.</p>

      <p>Now, with every major Komodo IDE release we've aimed to make things work <em>smarter and faster</em> than they were working before. Komodo IDE 7 is no exception to this rule and you'll notice a lot snappier Komodo <strong>startup time</strong>, lower <strong>CPU utilization</strong> - particularly when idle, and lower <strong>memory usage</strong> for large projects. Additionally, tools like the <strong>fast-find</strong> bar make it even quicker to do the common things you use the most.</p>
