          <p><img alt="" class="nostyling" src="/images/blog/2013-05/komodo-baby-03.jpg" style="width: 232px; height: 130px;">This month, ActiveState is running a Komodo IDE fundraiser. <strong>$50 of each license sold</strong> of Komodo IDE or ActivePerl/Tcl Pro Studio will go towards efforts for the <strong>conservation of endangered species</strong> such as the Komodo Dragon.</p>
  <p>As a thank you gift, each customer will receive a gift bag containing an official certificate and an <strong>awesome Komodo plushie</strong>!</p>

  <h3 style="padding-top: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Why the Promotion?</h3>
  <p>The Komodo Dragon is a marvel of nature. It is the world's largest living species of lizard, and one of the last surviving species of megafauna from the Pleistocene.</p>
  <p>Given this level of awesomeness, we couldn't help but adopt the Komodo at ActiveState as a powerful symbol for our products. But that association also warrants a recognition of the importance of the natural world, and how it still resonates with us even as a technological skilled society.</p>
  <p>Indeed, as a company of developers, we have a tendency to appreciate the natural world through our various pursuits in photography, astronomy or even a general interest in scientific discovery.</p>
  <p>For that reason, surely we can contribute a small sum of our fortunes for a worthy cause: the preservation of mighty creatures that inspire our imagination and drive to innovate.</p>
  <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
  <p>It's easy!</p>
