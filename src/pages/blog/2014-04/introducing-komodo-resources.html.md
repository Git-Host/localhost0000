We've overhauled the website, we've overhauled the forums, and now -- we've overhauled
the "addon directory", now called the "Resources" section. The Resources section
does not just list addons, it shows you any type of Resource that will facilitate
your work with Komodo; addons, macros, snippets, languages, skins, etc.

## Beta

It's worth noting that the new Resources section is still in Beta, there is still
a lot more we want to do with it but we want to allow the community to weigh in
on how we proceed, so please - [let yourself be heard][forum] if you have any
ideas / strong opinions.

## Submitting Resources

The Komodo Resources section lives off of github, you can simply submit your github
repository URL to the [Komodo-Resources repo] and our importer will take care of the
rest. For detailed instructions please refer to the [How To Contribute page].

## The Future

As I said we have many plans for the Resources section, in particular we will be
focussing on;

 * Importing from GitHub gists
 * Hooking into the Komodo addon manager (currently Resources are not accessible from within Komodo yet)
 * Adding statistics (top addons, resources, developers, etc)
 * etc.

 Again, if you have ideas you'd like to share - [please let us know][forum]!
