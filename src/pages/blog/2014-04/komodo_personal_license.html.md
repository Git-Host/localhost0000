We are very excited to let you know that (for a limited time only) we are
offering a [special Personal license] of Komodo IDE to individual developers
for **$89**.

[special Personal license]: /pricing/

## Why

Well, we're giving individual developers (the little guys) a break. At 30% of
the cost of the enterprise Komodo IDE license, these savings should go a long
way in helping achieve [maximum developer efficiency]... aka buying beer :P

## Limitations

Note that there are restrictions that have been placed on the Komodo IDE
Personal license, see below:
* we are only offering this special Personal license for a limited time
* a company cannot reimburse you the cost of the license - companies should
  purchase the enterprise Komodo IDE license
* you cannot purchase Upgrades and Support on this license
* you cannot transfer your license to another owner
* there will be no upgrade path to Komodo IDE 9

## Features

There are no change software changes - the personal license uses the same Komodo
IDE software, so you get [all the features] of Komodo IDE (multiple languages,
debugging, source code control), and you are able to use this license to develop
commercial software, just like you would with the enterprise Komodo IDE license.

[all the features]: /features/

## Enjoy

We hope you can take advantage of this special Komodo IDE Personal license and
we're glad we could offer it to you.

If you've got any questions, or feedback - please let us know.

Cheers,
Todd
