Good news everyone! After testing the Personal license for a few months
we&#39;ve come to the conclusion that we would really like to keep it around.
The following changes will be made to the license:

 * Personal will now cost **$99**
 * *Major upgrades* will cost **$59**
 * A *yearly subscription* will cost **$39**

Check out our [License Details page] for more information on what these prices
entail, in short; Personal has the exact same features as the Enterprise version,
the only difference is in who is allowed to purchase it. To find out how the
Personal license differs from the Enterprise license check out our
[License Comparison page].

<div class="centered">
    <a href="http://komodoide.com/pricing" class="button big primary">
        <i class="icon icon-basket"></i>
        Buy Komodo IDE Personal
    </a>
</div>

For people that already bought Komodo personal this means that they do not have
to worry about paying a hefty upgrade price when the next major version is
released. Additionally they can now add a yearly subscription to their license
for only **$39**.

We hope you're as excited as we are about Komodo Personal. Stay tuned for our
brand new Komodo newsletter for even more exciting news.
