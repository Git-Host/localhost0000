Our *Komodo 8.5/Back to Work* promotion is coming to a close next Monday, September 30.

Now is the time to get licenses of Perl Dev Kit, Tcl Dev Kit, Komodo IDE or Pro Studio, as we rarely offer discounts on our developer tools.

This week only, take advantage of the following promotional pricing:

<img src="/images/blog/09-2013/dev-tools-on-sale.png" align="right">

**[Perl Dev Kit (PDK)][2] and [Tcl Dev Kit (TDK)][3]**

  * Single license **$245** (reg. $295)
  * 5-packs **$1,415** (reg. $1,615)

**[Komodo IDE 8.5][4] \- Just Released**

  * Single license **$245** (reg. $295)
  * 5-packs **$1,415** (reg. $1,615)
  * Upgrades **$118** (reg. $168)

**[ActivePerl Pro Studio][5] and [ActiveTcl Pro Studio][6]**

  * Single license **$495** (reg. $595)
  * 5-Packs **$1,890** (reg. $2,390)

We also recommend that you include the Upgrades &amp; Support subscription with new licenses. For $87 per year, you get professional technical support and all product upgrades, which is a much better value than the one-time upgrade rate of $168. Pro Studio includes one year of Upgrades &amp; Support.

If you haven't evaluated our developer tools, you still have one week to do so before the promotion ends. Please feel free to contact us if you have questions or need a quote.
