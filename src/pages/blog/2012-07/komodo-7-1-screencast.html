          <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/lvKMvFK5O_8" rel="shadowbox;width=853;height=530" title="Komodo IDE - New in 7.1"><img class="as_left" style="float:left " alt="Komodo IDE - New in 7.1" src="/images/blog/2012-07/scast-komodo-intro-0.jpg"></a> <a target="_new" href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide/downloads">Komodo IDE 7.1</a> is out! I've put together a short screencast to demo all the great <a target="_new" href="http://docs.activestate.com/komodo/7.1/">new features</a> we've added.</p>
  
  <p>Here's a summary of what I cover in the video.</p>
  
  <h2>Variable Highlighting</h2>
  
  <p>First off, we've added variable highlighting. When you click on a variable, all the other instances of that variable are highlighted, making it easy to track where your variables are being used in a particular function.</p>
  
  <h2>DVCS Push</h2>
  
  <p>We've also <a target="_new" title="Komodo Docs: Push Dialog" href="http://docs.activestate.com/komodo/7.1/scc.html#push_dialog">improved support</a> for distributed version control systems: Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar. You can now 'push' your changes back to the repository. In the video example using Git, I make a change, commit it and push it. The new interface gives you the option to choose the branch you want to push to, as well as the tags.</p>
  
  <h2>Debugging in Stackato</h2>
  
  <p>Stackato integration has been enhanced with the ability to <a target="_new" title="Debugging with Stackato" href="http://docs.activestate.com/komodo/7.1/stackato.html#debugging_applications">debug applications</a> within a cloud environment. From the Stackato dialogue option, you simply choose "Configure Debugger" and set it to work on the Komodo host name and port number.</p>
  
  <h2>Adding your own language</h2>
  
  <p>We've made it really easy to <a target="_new" title="http://docs.activestate.com/komodo/7.1/extensions.html#language_extensions" href="http://docs.activestate.com/komodo/7.1/extensions.html#language_extensions">add support for new languages</a>. For example, in this video I create a Go extension within a few minutes. You start a new project from a template, set handling of line and block comments, copy &amp; paste keywords, and Komodo creates the package information. Click "Build and Install" in your toolbox, restart Komodo, and Go support (syntax highlighting and keyword autocompletion) is up and running.</p>
  
  <h2>Updates</h2>
  
  <p>Finally, we've upgraded support for the newest versions of existing languages: PHP 5.4, Node.js 0.8, Ruby 1.9.3, Python 3.3 and Perl 5.16.</p>
