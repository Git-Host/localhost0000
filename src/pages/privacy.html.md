ActiveState is committed to respecting your right to privacy while using our site. This Privacy Policy contains information regarding our privacy practices for the entire ActiveState site (including [www.activestate.com][1] and [aspn.activestate.com][2]).

## Information Collection and Use

ActiveState is the sole owner of the customer information collected on this site. We will not share this information in any ways other than those disclosed in this statement. ActiveState collects information from our users at several points on our website.

## Information Requests

Throughout our site, you are provided with the opportunity to contact us via email to ask questions, request information and materials, register for online presentations, or provide comments and suggestions. You may also be offered the opportunity to have one of our representatives contact you to provide information about our products or services. We may request additional personal information from you, such as your name and telephone number, to help us satisfy your request.

## Online Forms with Mollom

ActiveState uses Mollom for online form processing.

This privacy policy explains how Mollom BVBA processes your personal data. Please read it carefully, as it specifies which rights you have and how you can exercise your rights.

_Mollom web service _– Mollom operates a web service that tries to determine the quality of messages posted to a website, and particularly tries to determine whether these messages are to be considered as unsolicited messages (also called "spam"). Nowadays, websites that allow visitors to contribute or post comments (such as blogs, discussion forums, wikis, etc.) are flooded with inappropriate commercial messages that are distracting for all visitors, and are sometimes even highly illegal. These commercial messages are often uploaded in an automatic way. Mollom's service screens messages before they are posted to the website.

_How Mollom works_ – When you post a message on a website that uses Mollom service (called "the website" in the remainder of this text), the website's server will first send your message – as well as some information about your identity (such as your IP address, name or nickname, e-mail address and OpenID) – to Molloms server. Molloms server will then compare your message and your identity details with all elements in our database, and perform several complex statistical computations in order to assess the quality of your message (e.g., spam, abuse, etc.).

If Molloms server then determines that the content of your message is of insufficient quality or constitutes spam or abuse, it will inform the website thereof. The website server may then decide to reject your message, or to provide you with an additional question to find out whether you are in fact a human being, and not a machine trying to send out as much commercial communications as possible. Please note that it is sometimes possible that our server wrongfully determines the actual quality of the content of your message, or wrongfully considers your message as spam or abuse.

_What Mollom stores about you _– Mollom stores all information provided to us by the website. This will include, in particular, the following personal data about you (to the extent effectively provided to us by the website): the content of your message, your name or nickname, IP address, user ID, OpenID, e-mail address, URL of your website, and the date and time you post a message.

_How long Mollom stores this data_ – Your data is stored in Molloms databases for at most two months. After this period of two months, Mollom can continue to store your data in anonymized way for a period of two years.

_How Mollom uses your personal data_ – Mollom uses your personal data to assess the quality of your message, and to find out whether your message constitutes spam, by comparing your data with all other data of all other users in our databases. Afterwards, Mollom also uses your personal data to make similar assessments for all other websites that use our service, as the more information we store in Molloms database, the better Mollom can assess whether a message is genuine.

While Mollom sometimes provide statistical information (trends, numbers, etc.) generated from our databases to third parties, please rest assured that you cannot be identified on the basis of this statistical information.

_Note that Mollom hates spam as much as you do_ – in fact, Mollom's service is specifically targeted at removing spam. So, Mollom will never provide your email address to third parties, and Mollom will never send any spam themselves to you. In most cases, Mollom will not even be aware of your e-mail address.

Also note that Mollom can provide access to your personal data in case of illegal or abusive use, or in case we receive orders from a competent legal authority.

_How Mollom protects you_ – Mollom is bound by the strict rules of Belgian and European data protection legislation, which prevents them from making unlawful use of your personal data. Please note that the website's operator may be bound by other rules, depending on his jurisdiction.

_Your rights_ – You have the right to gain access to, correct and/or remove all personal data we store about you on our servers. All this is provided to you free of charge. In order to exercise your rights, please [contact Mollom][3].

## Security

Our website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When a user submits sensitive information, it is protected both online and offline. Where our registration/order form requires sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted with SSL, the best encryption software in the industry. While on a secure page such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked or open.

## Suppliers

We outsource shipping and credit card processing. The companies that perform these services do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes

## Links

This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that ActiveState is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the ActiveState website.

## Public Forums

ASPN makes mailing list archives, chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. As any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public, caution should be exercised when disclosing personal information.

## Choice/Opt-in

Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-in" to having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our order form has an "opt-in" mechanism so purchasers who wish to receive marketing material can add their email address to our lists. We only add users to our lists when they expressly agree to be added. Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.

Please be aware that you may not opt out of receiving information regarding the initial use, evaluation, or expiration of our products or services.

If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
