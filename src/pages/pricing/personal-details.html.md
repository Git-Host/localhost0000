The Komodo Personal license (Komodo IDE for individuals) is meant for
individuals that are purchasing Komodo using their own funds. You cannot be
reimbursed for your purchase by a company. You may not buy more than one
Personal Edition license (no bulk purchases).

Minor updates to the software (eg. 8.5.x) are included in this license, you will
not be charged for them.

The Personal license is non-transferrable. It allows you to use Komodo on more
than one computer or on a network, so long as you are the sole user of the
software.

Komodo IDE features and functionality are identical between all license versions,
the Personal license does NOT add any restrictions on the type of projects you
can use the software for.
