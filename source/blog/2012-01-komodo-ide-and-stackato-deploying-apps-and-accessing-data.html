  <p>I've been doing a lot of demos of <a href="http://www.activestate.com/cloud">Stackato</a> lately and starting to incorporate the new <a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide/downloads">Komodo IDE 7</a> client interface (currently RC). Without further ado, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/OmFv19JzreI" rel="shadowbox;width=640;height=530" title="Komodo IDE and Stackato">here's the screencast</a>!</p>
  
  <p>It was tough to decide what to show. Debugging applications running on the micro cloud is pretty cool but it's better demonstrated in a written tutorial (which I'll be writing up soon). Showing off the DB Explorer is a little more visually interesting.</p>
  
  <h2 style="clear:both">DB Explorer, dbshell, and tunnel</h2>
  
  <p>As the screencast shows, it's extremely simple to connect to a locally running micro cloud from Komodo. That's because Komodo has integration with the <a href="http://activestate.com/blog/2011/11/connecting-database-services-stackato">'stackato dbshell' command</a>, which has been part of the client for a while longer than the newer <a href="http://activestate.com/blog/2011/12/new-stackato-client-tunneling-and-https">'tunnel' command</a>. Komodo will have better hooks into 'tunnel' in future releases, but for now, it's fairly trivial to set up a connection to the database manually as shown.</p>
  
  <h2 style="clear:both">What you'll need to follow along</h2>
  
  <p>If you'd like to try this all out for yourself, you'll need:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <a href="http://community.activestate.com/stackato/download">Stackato micro cloud VM</a>: There's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CunjLaS7Rzo">another screencast</a> that shows how to get this set up. If your local system doesn't have the resources to run a VM, feel free to use the Stackato Sandbox instead.</li>
    <li>
  <a href="http://community.activestate.com/stackato/download">Stackato client</a>: Komodo uses this stand-alone executable in the background. You may need to do some minor <a href="http://docs.stackato.com/quick-start.html#stackato-client-setup">client setup</a> after download.</li>
    <li>
  <a href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide/downloads">Komodo IDE 7</a>: Download an RC build (or a trial of the release, depending on when you're reading this) and set the path to the 'stackato' executable in Komodo's Stackato preferences if it's not in your system $PATH.</li>
    <li>
  <a href="http://community.activestate.com/stackato/demos">Sample apps</a>: We've put together a <a href="https://github.com/ActiveState/stackato-samples">Github repo</a> full of sample applications in a variety of languages.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Let us know what you think!</h2>
  
  <p>As always, we would like to hear your feedback on how this works for you, and what you would like to see in future releases. You can do that in the <a href="http://community.activestate.com/forum/stackato/feedback">Stackato Feedback</a> and <a href="http://community.activestate.com/forums/komodo/komodo-beta">Komodo Beta</a> forums.</p>
