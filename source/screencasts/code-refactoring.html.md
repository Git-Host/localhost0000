A great new feature we've added to Komodo 8.5 is code refactoring. You can rename elements without using a Find & Replace dialogue. For example, you can rename every instance of an element by right-clicking on one instance and selecting "rename variable".

You can also rename class instances. You can customize the directories Komodo will search, as well as the type of files it will examine. It will ask you to confirm replacements not only for the exact instances but similar occurrences you may wish to update as well.

The third feature we've added is the ability to create new methods from a selection of code using extract method, ie. you can select a piece of code and move it to a new function.
