We've added a new widget to the Komodo statusbar called Breadcrumbs. Clicking on the file entry, you can access any of its parent items, which gives access to the directory above each item. You can easily navigate this structure to open related files. As you change files, Breadcrumbs updates itself to your relative location. You can also use the keyboard to navigate Breadcrumbs.
