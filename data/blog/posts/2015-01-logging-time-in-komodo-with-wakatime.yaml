:body: ! "\n<img src=\"/assets/images/blog/2015-01/wakatime.png\" align=\"right\">\n\nI'm
  sure many of our users use time tracking software on a daily basis, using all\nsorts
  of tools to get the job done. I myself am no stranger to the likes of Harvest,\nFreshbooks,
  and have usually used those tools in combination with some systray\napp that lets
  me quickly track time. For me the problem has always been that I\ntend to forget
  to start and stop my timers, I am way too ADD to be train myself\nto do this consistently.\n\nA
  while ago a new Komodo addon was submitted that seeks to address issues like\nthis
  simply by using your editor activity as a means of tracking your time,\nallowing
  you to just do what you normally do without having to worry about\nmanually starting
  or stopping some meter.\n\n<img src=\"/assets/images/blog/2015-01/wakatime-screenshot.png\"
  align=\"right\">\n\nIt hooks into [Komodo's Project functionality][1] to identify
  what you are working on,\nautomatically grouping your hours into the appropriate
  Project. So if you tend\nto jump between many client projects during the day and
  are already using Komodo\nProjects (if not - you should!) then this will all work
  right out of the box for you!\n\nInstallation is simple, just download the addon
  from our Resources section and\ndrag it onto Komodo. Sign up on [WakaTime.com] and
  copy your API key from the settings page.  On restarting Komodo, input the key when
  prompted and you are good to go!  Note it\nmay take a couple of minutes before data
  appears on [WakaTime.com] for the first\ntime but after that it should update real-time.
  The default time out value is 15\nminutes but you can change that in settings.\n\nSo
  a big thanks to WakaTime to filling this void, having time tracking built right\ninto
  Komodo is a big bonus which I'm sure many of you will like!\n\n<div class=\"centered\">\n
