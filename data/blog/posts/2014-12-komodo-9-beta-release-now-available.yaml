  What's New\n\nHere is a list of the major features and product changes made in Komodo
  9:\n\n### Track Changes\n\n<a href=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-12/trackchanges.png\"
  class=\"lightbox\" title=\"Track Changes mockup - subject to change - click to enlarge\">\n<img
  src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-12/trackchanges-thumb.png\" align=\"right\">\n</a>\n\nThe
  editor has gained a new left margin - which highlights unsaved changes, as\nwell
  as any uncommitted SCC changes. Clicking on the margin will show a diff\ndialog
  of the changes - as well as letting you revert individual changes! Sweet!\n\n<div
  class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n\n### Markdown Viewer\n\n<a href=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-12/markdown-viewer.png\"
  class=\"lightbox\" title=\"Markdown viewer - click to enlarge screenshot\">\n<img
  src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-12/markdown-viewer-thumb.png\" align=\"right\">\n</a>\n\nFor
  Markdown files, Komodo provides a preview of the generated HTML directly\nwithin
  a Komodo split view and contents will dynamically update itself whenever\nyou make
  a change to the Markdown text - it doesn't even need to be saved. You\ncan check
  out the [markdown blog post] for more details on this feature.\n\n<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n\n###
  Go Programming Language Support\n\n<img src=\"http://komodoide.com/assets/images/blog/2014-10/golang-logo.png\"
  align=\"right\">\n\nGolang is now becoming supported in Komodo. We provide syntax
  coloring, code\nfolding, syntax checking (linting) and code intelligence with completions,\ncalltips,
  outline and goto definition for .go files. Please check out the\n[golang blog post]
  for more details on this support.\n\n<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n\n### Commando\n\n<a
  href=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-12/commando.png\" class=\"lightbox\" title=\"Commando
  - click to enlarge screenshot\">\n<img src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-12/commando-thumb.png\"
  align=\"right\">\n</a>\n\nThis popup dialog is the combined successor of the *Fast
  Open* and *Invoke Tool*\ndialogs in Komodo 8. Commando provides fuzzy matching,
  match highlighting,\nsearch for files (find any file under a folder), toolbox search,
  bookmark\nintegration, shortcuts (go-tool) integration as well as custom category\nfiltering.\n\n<div
  class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n\n### <a href=\"http://kopy.io/\">Kopy.io</a> Helper\n\n<a
  href=\"http://kopy.io/\">\n<img src=\"http://kopy.io/img/pastebin-logo-dark.png\"
  align=\"right\">\n</a>\n\nNow you can easily share snippets of code with other people
  (like pastebin)\ndirectly from Komodo. Simple make a text selection and use the
  editor\nright-click context menu and choose *Share Code via Kopy.io*. Even better
  is that\nKopy.io supports client side encryption, so you can make those shared pastes\nmore
  secure.\n\n<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n\n### Notifications UI\n\n<a href=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-12/notify.png\"
  class=\"lightbox\" title=\"Notifications UI - click to enlarge screenshot\">\n<img
  src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-12/notify-thumb.png\" align=\"right\">\n</a>\n\nNotification
  messages shown to the user now appear in a separate popup panel\nthat overlays the
  main Komodo editor window (previously they appeared in the\nKomodo statusbar). Komodo
  also has notification preferences, allowing you to\ncontrol which messages get displayed
  in the popup panel.\n\n<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n\n### Icons\n\nMost of the
  icons in Komodo user interface have been updated to use improved\nimages or to use
  a consistent style. We've tweaked the file icons, language\nicons, places icons,
  toolbox icons, preference page icons and code intelligence\nicons (completions,
  sections list, code browser).\n\n<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n\n### Editor Color
  Schemes\n\nWe've changed all the default Komodo color schemes. All Komodo color
  schemes now\nuse Base16, that is, they are based on a set of 16 different base colors,
  which\nare then re-used in different parts of that scheme.\n\nWe also added the
  ability to tweak the editor line height spacing, which is now\nsaved in the color
  scheme preferences page.\n\n### Menu Bar\n\nThe Komodo main menu bar (i.e. the File,
  Edit, ...) is now hidden by default on\nWindows and Linux. You can use the Alt key
  to toggle the menu visibility, or\nforce it be always displayed through the *View
  > Toolbars* menu.\n\nWhilst the top-level menu is hidden, a unified menu button
  will be visible in\nthe top-right of the Komodo toolbar, or if the toolbar is also
  hidden, then it\nwill appear in the Komodo view status bar.\n\n### PHP 5.6 Support\n\nWe've
  added support for PHP 5.6, with a new Xdebug module (for PHP debugging and\nCode
  Profiling), updates for keyword changes and updates to code intelligence to\nprovide
  the latest API data for PHP 5.6.\n\n### Python Updates\n\nPython 3.4 is fully supported
  for syntax checking, debugging, code intelligence,\netc...\n\nWe've added PEP 8
  syntax checking - you can enable this in the Python Syntax\nChecking preferences.
  For those that don't know - PEP 8 is the official [Style\nGuide for Python Code](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).\n\n###
  Komodo Developer APIs\n\nWe've been overhauling the Komodo APIs, to make it easier
  to load and access the\nmethods inside of Komodo. We're now making use of CommonJS
  (aka Node.js)\nrequire() calls to load individual modules - you can see the full
  list of\nsupported modules in the Komodo [sdk directory]. Examples of use and more\ninformation
  can be found in the [Komodo wiki].\n\nWe've also added convenient console.log()
  and friends support - the messages\nshow up in the Komodo notifications pane.\n\nThere
  are other changes that Komodo Add-on developers should be aware of - we've\nbeen
  documenting these major changes on our [Komodo wiki] page.\n\n### Performance Tweaks\n\nWe've
  made a bunch of performance tweaks to Komodo 9 already - with more to\nfollow. So
  far we've been concentrating on two main areas:\n\n* *Startup* - we've managed to
  improve Komodo startup times by around 15%.\n\n* *Editor typing speed* - various
  editing features have been improved, which\n  should be most noticeable in larger
  files, especially HTML/XML.\n\n* *Search* - improved performance of find next/previous
  calls\n\n* *Syntax Checking* - Faster syntax checking times\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n*
  *Statusbar moved* - it's now attached to the bottom of the editor view (and\n  not
  to the bottom of the window)\n* *Preferences page* - now has *simple* and *advanced*
  modes\n* *Startpage* - now removed - a Quick Launch page is now displayed when no
  views are opened\n* *Custom workspaces* - can be saved and loaded on demand, use
  the File > Workspace menu\n* *High DPI* - should work correctly on Windows - no
  blurred fonts\n* *Tab width* - the indentation preference has changed from 8 spaces
  to 4 spaces\n* *Commit dialog* - now displays the current branch name\n* *Menus*
  - various menus were re-organised, including tab and editor context menus\n* *Sections
  list* - has merged with breadcrumbs widget\n* *Copy find results* - which can be
  used via the toolbar in the find results widget\n* *Primary language cleanup* -
  less used languages like (XBL, XUL, Luddite) no\n  longer appear in the main menu
  - though your free to adjust these in the\n  Komodo *Languages* preferences.\n*
  *Mozilla 31* - Komodo is now built on top of the Mozilla 31 code base\n* *Analytics*
  - We now analyze how our users use Komodo to help us improve our\n  product. This
  is entirely optional and we do not track user specific\n  information. You can [view
  our Analytics code on\n  github](https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit/blob/master/src/modules/analytics/content/analytics.js).\n\n##
  Questions?\n\n**Q:** When will Komodo 9 be released?<br>\n**A:** We've not set a
  firm deadline - but it will likely be early next year.\n\n**Q:** What else is coming
  in Komodo 9?<br>\n**A:** This is most of the big feature plans we have for Komodo
  9, we've got a\nfew other things planned, but mostly the focus will be on bug fixes
  and polish\nuntil Komodo 9 final is released.\n\n**Q:** What about Komodo Edit?<br>\n**A:**
  Komodo Edit builds are not being released yet - they will be included later in\nthe
  preview cycle - as we wanted to start with the focus being on Komodo IDE.\n\n**Q:**
  I have more questions!<br>\n**A:** [Talk to us directly on the forums!](http://forum.komodoide.com/)\n\n\n[markdown
