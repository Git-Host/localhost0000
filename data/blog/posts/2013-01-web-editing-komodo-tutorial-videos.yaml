  style=\"height: 128px; width: 128px;\">Recently, a university professor contacted
  us about using Komodo as a teaching tool for his course on web design. He wanted
  to know if we could refer him to any educational resources demonstrating web editing
  with Komodo.</p>\n  <p>I referred him to our <a href=\"#html-css\">HTML, CSS and
  JavaScript screencast</a>, which highlights some of Komodo's editing features. I
  also discovered that there are a number of great user-made videos on the topic.
  I reviewed them and recommended the most useful ones. FYI, they're not in-depth
  language tutorials, but they give you an idea of how to get started on a project
  using Komodo.</p>\n  <p>Since I suspect this is a common topic of interest for educators
  and newbies such as myself, I thought I would share my recommendations on this blog.
  Hopefully at least one of these videos inspires you to make a kick-ass web application,
  or at least give your WYSIWYG the boot.</p>\n  <p>You can download <a href=\"http://activestate.com/komodo-edit/downloads\"
  target=\"_blank\">Komodo Edit (free) here</a>, or the free <a href=\"http://activestate.com/komodo-ide/downloads\"

  video is the most recent, using Komodo 7.1. It shows the basic process of creating
  an HTML file, editing it, previewing it and saving it, while showing off some cool
  Komodo features.</p>\n  <p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\"

  font-weight: normal;\">posted by fsupic</span>\n  </h3>\n  <p><span style=\"line-height:
  1.3em;\">Here's another take on starting a project, with the addition of creating
  your own HTML5 template from a regular HTML template. This was posted as part of
  a Florida State University program.</span></p>\n  <p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\"

  \ <p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:
  14px; line-height: 1.3em;\">By now you probably get the idea. These are good introductions,
  but the rest is up to you. The next step is simply to start a project with Komodo,
  get a feel for it, and use it in conjunction with your web editing course (or self-education).</span></p>\n
  \ <p>Good luck and happy editing!</p>\n  <h3>Related Notes</h3>\n  <p><a href=\"http://activestate.com/blog/authors/careyh\">CaryH</a>
