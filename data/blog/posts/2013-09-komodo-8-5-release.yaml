  style=\"width: 252px; height: 90px; float: left;\"></a>I am pleased to announce
  that Komodo IDE and Edit 8.5.0 are officially released.</p>\n  <p>On behalf of the
  Komodo team, I'd like to thank all of our beta testers, customers, and anyone who
  has given feedback over the years. Komodo continues to evolve as a leading IDE thanks
  to your efforts.</p>\n  <p>You will find that Komodo 8.5 adds significant productivity-enhancing
  features while building upon the refreshed UI and navigation introduced in 8.0.
  One of these UI updates is the much-requested Abyss theme, which adds a \"touch
  of darkness\" to your development. You will also enjoy faster performance from various
  tweaks and code intel improvements.</p>\n  <p>This screencast highlights some of
  the notable new features:</p>\n  <p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"

  \ <p><strong>Code Refactoring</strong>: Simplifies project-wide code changes with
  these smart transformation capabilities for PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, JavaScript
  and Node.js:</p>\n  <ul>\n  <li>\n  <strong>Rename Variable</strong>: Quickly rename
  variables using inline markers and multiple cursor selections</li>\n  <li>\n  <strong>Rename
  Class Member</strong>: Similar to rename variable, but works on all instances and
  across multiple files, with an added confirmation step so you can verify and select
  the instanced you want replaced</li>\n  <li>\n  <strong>Method Extraction</strong>:
  Move parts of your code into a new function. Any variables used in the selected
  text are refactored into function arguments and are then passed to the extracted
  method.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><strong>Breadcrumbs</strong>: A file and directory navigation
  bar has been added to the statusbar. It shows the directory ancestores relative
  to the current editor file, allowing you to easily find and open related files.
  You can use mouse and/or keyboard to navigate entries and filter down the list of
  files displayed.</p>\n  <p><strong>Multiple Selections</strong>: In addition to
  Komodo's column/block editing, you can now select multiple positions in the editory.
  Typing in one position will be reflected at all selected positions. Right-click
  in the editor and choose \"<em>Select --&gt; Multiple Selection --&gt; Add</em>\",
  then use Ctrl+Click (Cmd+Click on Mac) to quickly make additional selections.</p>\n
  \ <p><strong>Abyss Theme</strong>: This dark theme applies to the UI elements outside
  of the main editor and can be enabled in the <em>Appearance</em> preferences. For
  maximum effect, select the \"Dark_Wombatsosia\" color scheme within the main editor.</p>\n
