:body: ! "\n## Go-lang Support\n\n<img src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-10/golang-logo.png\"
  align=\"right\"/>\n\nThere has been a Komodo Go add-on available for a while now,
  but for Komodo 9\nwill be including the go-lang add-on in the default Komodo builds
  and improving\nKomodo's support for [go programming].\n\n## Features\n\nThe add-on
  currently supports \n\n* Language detection of .go files\n* Syntax Coloring\n* Code
  Folding\n* Syntax Checking (aka Linting)\n* Codeintel Completions and Calltips (requires
  [Gocode][] to be installed)\n* Code Outline (for Code Browser and Sections List
  in IDE)\n* Go to Definition (requires [godef][] to be installed)\n\n## Source Code\n\nThe
  code for the Go language support is open-source at GitHub, in the\n[komodo-go] repository.
  We've love to hear from people trying the add-on, and\nhopefull we'll see contributions
  from other users.\n\n## Screenshot\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Komodo/komodo-go/raw/master/example.png\"/>\n\n##
  Add-on History\n\nThe add-on was originally started by [Trent Mick][] as a general
  UDL language\nextension back in 2010. Over the next few years [Travis Cline][] took
  it to the\nnext level, adding Syntax Checking, Codeintel Completions, Calltips and
  Goto\nDefinition support to the add-on (using [Gocode][]).\n[Eric Promislow][] added
  smoother language integration (koIAppInfo) and language\npreferences in 2013. We
  (the Komodo team) moved the code into the main Komodo\nGitHub repository. I added
  Code Intelligence outlining (for Code Browser and\nSections List in Komodo IDE)
  and then included the add-on in the Komodo 9\ndefault builds.\n\n## Installation\n\nFor
  Komodo 9 users, the \"Go Language\" add-on is already included in your Komodo\ninstallation.\n\nFor
  Komodo 8 users, visit the GitHub page to download and install the add-on.\n\n\n\n[go
