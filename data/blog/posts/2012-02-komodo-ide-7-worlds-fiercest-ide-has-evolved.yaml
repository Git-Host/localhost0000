  new technologies and innovative enhancements. Here's an introduction to the most
  prominent features it includes.</p>\n  \n  <ul style=\"clear:both\">\n  <li>\n      <p><strong><a
  href=\"http://activestate.com/komodo-ide/features#collaboration\" title=\"Code Collaboration\">Code
  Collaboration</a></strong> is one of the coolest things to use in a team development
  environment. You can easily share your files and collaborate in real time with your
  colleagues and friends. Peer reviews and pair programming become a much more intuitive
  and interactive experience with Komodo's collaboration tools.</p>\n      \n      <a

  src=\"/assets/images/blog/2012-02/ko7-sync.png\" class=\"as_feature_img as_right\"><p>For
  those that use multiple machines, Komodo's <strong><a href=\"http://activestate.com/komodo-ide/features#sync\"
  title=\"Komodo Sync\">Synchronization</a></strong> feature gives you the ability
  to copy your Komodo settings (remote server accounts, toolbox, file templates...)
  between all the Komodo instances. So you can customize Komodo in one place and have
  the same setup appear in another!</p>\n    </li>\n      \n      \n    <li style=\"clear:both\">\n
  \     <p>The <strong><em>cloud</em></strong> is a new and exciting playground for
  developers. Komodo's <strong><a href=\"http://activestate.com/komodo-ide/features#stackato\"
  title=\"Stackato Integration\">Stackato</a></strong> interface provides the ability
  to quickly deploy web based applications onto cloud infrastructure - you can have
  your application running on the cloud within minutes! A slew of languages and frameworks
  are supported - such as <em>Python</em>, <em>Django</em>, <em>Ruby</em>, <em>Rails</em>,
  <em>PHP</em>, <em>Drupal</em>, <em>Perl</em>, <em>Mojolicious</em>, <em>Node.js</em>
  and even <em>Java</em>!</p>\n  \n      \n      <a rel=\"shadowbox[Screenshots]\"

  \     <p><a href=\"http://activestate.com/komodo-ide/features#node.js\" title=\"Node.js
  support\"><strong>Node.js support</strong></a> - Komodo IDE brings in debugging,
  code intelligence, editor and syntax checking support for Node applications. As
  well as this, Komodo IDE 7 provides additional support for web and template languages
  like <em>CoffeeScript</em>, <em>LESS</em>, <em>SCSS</em>, <em>EJS</em> and <em>Mojolicious</em>.</p>\n

  the ability to <strong><a href=\"http://activestate.com/komodo-ide/features#profiling\"
  title=\"Code Profiling for PHP and Python\">Code Profile</a></strong> your application
  - you can now find out why that <em>PHP</em> or <em>Python</em> code is taking so
  long to run! Komodo shows a graphical representation of the methods and calls made
  by your program, as well as outlining the CPU time spent executing your code. Automatic
  time sorting makes it easy to see the code hot-spots at a single glance.</p>\n  \n
  \   <a rel=\"shadowbox[Screenshots]\" href=\"http://activestate.com/sites/default/files/blog_import_images/ko7_code_profiling.png\">\n

  class=\"as_feature_img as_left\"></a>\n  \n    </li>\n      \n    <li>\n      <p>Now,
  with every major Komodo IDE release we've aimed to make things work <em>smarter
  and faster</em> than they were working before. Komodo IDE 7 is no exception to this
  rule and you'll notice a lot snappier Komodo <strong>startup time</strong>, lower
  <strong>CPU utilization</strong> - particularly when idle, and lower <strong>memory
  usage</strong> for large projects. Additionally, tools like the <strong>fast-find</strong>
  bar make it even quicker to do the common things you use the most.</p>\n  \n       <img
