  style=\"width: 230px; height: 138px;\">Komodo 8.0 is set to release on Thursday,
  March 7, and to say we're excited is a huge understatement.</p>\n  <p>Every Komodo
  release is a big deal, but this one's really going to be a killer. With a totally
  refreshed UI and major updates to editing and workflow, 8.0 promises to deliver
  an incredible user experience.</p>\n  <p><strong>Note: Anyone who has purchased
  Komodo IDE on or after Feb. 7, 2013...</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>Don't worry! You
  will automatically receive an upgrade to Komodo IDE 8.0.</strong></p>\n  <p>Here
  is what you can expect from Komodo 8.0:</p>\n  <ul>\n  <li>\n  <strong>New User
  Interface</strong>: Lean, clean UI hides features you don't use and feels native
  to each OS.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul>\n  <li>\n  <strong>Floating Side Panes</strong>:
  Lots of user requests for this. Finally, undock side panes and move them around
  to anywhere on screen or on a separate monitor.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul>\n  <li>\n
  \ <strong>Auto Abbreviations</strong>: Type the first few characters to automatically
  trigger snippet selection.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul>\n  <li>\n  <strong>Open Files Side
  Pane</strong>: Organize all your open files by language.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul>\n
  \ <li>\n  <strong>Conditional Snippets</strong>: Use JavaScript to programatically
  determine snippet contents at runtime.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul>\n  <li>\n  <strong>Mini-Map</strong>:
  Lots of user requests for this too. Mouse and reposition anywhere on a high-level
  view of your code.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <ul>\n  <li><strong>Retina support for Mac OS
  X!</strong></li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><strong>There's more. A lot more</strong>. Check
  out <a href=\"http://activestate.com/blog/2013/02/komodo-8-beta-available\">Todd's
  blog post</a> for a more detailed rundown, and <a href=\"http://activestate.com/blog/2013/02/komodo-8-user-interface\">Nathan's
  blog post</a> on the new UI -- the post itself is an example of jquery magic.</p>\n
  \ <p>Thanks to all beta users for your participation and feedback so far. If you
  haven't previewed Komodo 8.0 yet, there's still time to do so. Download Komodo 8.0.0c1
