  7: Syntax Checking\" style=\"width: auto\" src=\"/assets/images/blog/2011-05/komodo-syntax-128.png\"
  class=\"as_feature_img as_left\"><p>The plan for rolling out <a href=\"http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide/downloads\">Komodo
  7</a> is to bring on a wave of new functionality with each new alpha.  This time
  the main difference is a revamp in the way we do as-you-type syntax checking.</p>\n
  \ \n  <h2>Revisiting syntax checking</h2>\n  \n  <p>First of all, we're no longer
  handing over HTML-based templates (like Django, RHTML, Mason, etc.) to HTML Tidy
  and hoping for the best. Komodo now splits each of these documents into separate
  parts, and then sends each section to the correct syntax checker. The contents of
  script tags are handed by a JavaScript checker, the code in style tags by a CSS
  checker, and everything else by the HTML checker.</p>\n  \n  <p>Next, the system
  easily supports <em>different</em> checkers.  For example, we're shipping <a href=\"http://www.jslint.com/\">JSLint</a>
  and <a href=\"http://jshint.com/\">JSHint</a> checkers for JavaScript. They're off
  by default, but you can control which ones to use on a per-document or per-project
  basis, following whatever makes sense. Similarly, if you've installed <a href=\"http://code.activestate.com/pypm/pylint/\">pylint</a>,
  <a href=\"http://code.activestate.com/pypm/pychecker/\">PyChecker</a>, or <a href=\"http://code.activestate.com/pypm/pyflakes/\">pyflakes</a>,
  you can now use them to vet your Python code.</p>\n  \n  <p>We've found there are
  two other HTML libraries written as Perl modules (<a href=\"http://code.activestate.com/ppm/HTML-Tidy/\">HTML::Tidy</a>
  and <a href=\"http://code.activestate.com/ppm/HTML-Lint/\">HTML::Lint</a>) that
  sometimes do better HTML checking than Tidy, so you now have the option of using
  those.  If you've moved to HTML5, you can check it with Komodo's built-in <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/\">html5lib</a>
  instead.</p>\n  \n  <h2>Roll your own</h2>\n  \n  <p>Finally, the new syntax checking
  system is fully extensible.  The three parts to add support for a new language are:
  UDL to describe the language, an XPCOM library to determine how the checking works,
  and a Mozilla extension to add new preference pages. If you just want to add support
  for a new checker for an existing language, you can do that with a simple Mozilla
  extension.</p>\n  \n  <h2>CoffeeScript!</h2>\n  \n  <p>Speaking of new languages,
  we've added support for CoffeeScript, the JavaScript preprocessor.  Currently it
  does coloring, and supports the same kind of indentation-level-based folding that
  Python does.  If Komodo finds a program called \"coffee\" on the PATH, it will do
  syntax-checking as well. If you're using a snazzy new template language that preprocesses
  CoffeeScript elements and converts them to regular JavaScript script elements for
  the browser, Komodo will now syntax-check that as well.</p>\n  \n  <h2>Updated Mozilla
  under the hood</h2>\n  \n  <p>The other main change is that this version of Komodo
  is now using the same version of Mozilla as Firefox 4.  Startup should definitely
  be faster, as most components can now be loaded on demand as they're needed, as
  opposed to loading everything initially on startup.  This also means extension writers
  can take advantage of new features in JavaScript 1.8.5</p>\n  \n  <p>Additionally
  there have been several <a href=\"http://docs.activestate.com/komodo/7.0/releases/ide.html#details\">bug
  fixes</a> since the last alpha, particularly in the new sync and collaboration modules.</p>\n</div>\n"
