:body: ! "\n<a style=\"font-size: 128px; margin: 10px;\" href=\"https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit\"
  class=\"push-right\">\n    <i class=\"icon icon-github\"></i>\n</a>\n\nThe source
  code for Komodo Edit is [now available on GitHub][github]. It has been for a short
  while now but we never quite anounced it, as we're still moving over parts of our
  codebase.\n\nKomodo is a huge supporter of open source software, and we are proud
  to show\nthat Komodo Edit has been open source for 7 years (since 2007) - licensed\nunder
  the [Mozilla Public License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Public_License)\n(MPL).
  Our code also makes use of many open source components, such as the\nMozilla Firefox
  platform and Python runtime.\n\nNote that for now our Komodo Edit GitHub repository
  is still mirroring an\nexisting [Subversion repository](http://svn.openkomodo.com/openkomodo),
  but soon\nall Komodo code will move away from Subversion, and the Komodo code-base
  will be\npurely under Git.\n\n## Why Git?\n\nWe've chosen to use Git over Subversion
  for these reasons:\n\n  * **Speed** - Git is durn fast\n  * **Distributed** - developers
  can work (and commit) locally without having\n    to connect back to a central repository.
  Commands run locally, rather than\n    having to fetch from a centralized server\n
  \ * **Commands** - with builtin commands like\n    *[git stash](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-stash.html)*\n
  \   and\n    *[git commit --amend](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-commit.html)*,\n
  \   it can be both clever and forgiving\n  * **Branching** - Git has lightweight
  branches with superior\n    merging capabilities (though I admit newer Subversion
  releases are\n    catching up in the merging department)\n  * **Fast** - did I mention
  Git is durn fast?!\n\nNow, with the good being said, we'd be remiss if we didn't
  mention a few rough\nedges as well:\n\n  * **Terminology** - with words like *origin*
  and *master*, it seems to better\n    fit in with a Star Wars movie, rather than
  source code control tools\n  * **Command line syntax** - *git reset --hard HEAD~1*
  and *git push origin\n    master*, you'd be forgiven if you banged your head on
  your first attempt at\n    using Git\n\nAll in all, we're pretty happy with the
  move to GitHub and look forward to using\nmore Git in the future.\n\n## Komodo on
  GitHub\n\nWe have already moved many of our code repositories onto the GitHub page,
  such as:\n\n### Website\n\nOur [new website](https://github.com/Komodo/komodo-website)
  that runs\non komodoide.com is all open-source and available under GitHub - for
  more\ndetails on how that works, check out Nathan's\n[blog post](http://komodoide.com/blog/2014-02/new-website-launched/).\n\n###
  Add-ons\n\n  * [Abyss Skin](https://github.com/Komodo/Mel) - this is the code for
  the new\n    dark skin (theme) in Komodo 8. Anyone wanting to create (or tweak)
  their own\n    skin should take a look at this\n  * [To-do Helper](https://github.com/Komodo/Todo)
  - adds a todo widget into the\n    bottom Komodo pane that will display any todo
  markers left in your source\n    code\n  * [Side By Side Diffs](https://github.com/Komodo/SideBySideDiff)
  - which\n    provides an alternative diff viewer in Komodo that shows a side-by-side
  file\n    comparison\n\n### Macros\n\n  * [Wrap Text](https://github.com/Komodo/macros#wrap-text)
  - wraps the editor\n    selection with custom text. Easily enclose text within HTML
  tags or\n    stringify a selection\n  * [PHPDoc and JSDoc](https://github.com/Komodo/macros#phpdoc-and-jsdoc)
  -\n    automatically creates javadoc style comments for functions and variables\n
  \ * [Incremental\n    Numbering](https://github.com/Komodo/macros#incremental-numbering)
  - inserts\n    a number into a column selection, incrementing the number for every
  line\n\nFor a more complete overview of our repos, check out [our GitHub Organization
  page][github org].\n\n## Git Functionality inside Komodo\n\n*What about Komodo itself
  - does it support Git?*\n\nKomodo IDE does indeed provide support for Git (but not
  Komodo Edit), showing\nthe file status directly inside of the IDE and providing
  commands for common\nactions like clone, pull, add, remove, diff, revert, commit,
  log and push.\n\nHere's screenshots of the Open Files pane showing source code control
  status and\nthe commit dialog ready to check in modified files:\n\n<div class=\"centered\">\n
  \   <img alt=\"SCC File Status\" src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-03/scc_file_status.png\">\n
  \   <img alt=\"SCC Commit\"      src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-03/scc_commit.png\">\n</div>\n\nPlease
  let us know if there are more things you'd like to see in Komodo with\nregards to
  Git.\n\n   [github]: https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit \"Komodo Edit on GitHub\"\n
