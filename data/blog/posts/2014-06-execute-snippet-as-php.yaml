  you might be editing a PHP script and you want to quickly execute a snippet\nof
  code to test it on it's own, or you might even want to simply use PHP to quickly\nperform
  some logic for you on the fly. It's with that in mind that I originally\ncreated
  this macro years ago. You simply write some code, select your code and\nexecute
  the macro to run your code and see the results. If you have no code\nselected then
  the current file is used. The best part for me is that the file\ndoes not need to
  be saved, allowing for quick testing.\n\nThis macro could easily be modified to
  support multiple languages, please feel\nfree to fork it and [submit your modifications][Resources
  Section].\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the macro simply hit the \"View Resource\"
  and \"Install Instructions\"\nlinks below. You'll want to hook the macro up to the
  \"On Startup\" trigger.\n\n<div class=\"centered\">\n    <div class=\"spacer\"></div>\n
  \   <a href=\"http://komodoide.com/resources/macros/naatan--executeasphp/\" class=\"button
  big primary\">\n        <i class=\"icon icon-eye\"></i>\n        View Resource\n
  \   </a>\n    <div class=\"spacer-half\"></div>\n    <span>\n        <i class=\"icon
  icon-question\"></i>\n        <a href=\"http://komodoide.com/resources/install-instructions/#pane-macro\"
  target=\"_blank\">Install Instructions</a>\n    </span>\n</div>\n\n## Share Your
  Own Awesome Macros\n\nDo you have your own awesome macro's that you think others
  could benefit from?\nSubmit them to the [Resources Section] and if you really want
  to get it noticed\n[write a Macro Monday blog about it][macromonday].\n\n   [Resources
