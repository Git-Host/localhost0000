:body: ! "\nWe are very excited to let you know that (for a limited time only) we
  are\noffering a [special Personal license] of Komodo IDE to individual developers.\nIf
  the new Personal license is well received it may actually get a\npermanent place
  in the Komodo lineup... we're hoping it does!\n\n[special Personal license]: /pricing/\n\n##
  Why\n\nWell, we're giving individual developers a break. At 30% of the cost of the\nenterprise
  Komodo IDE license, these savings should go a long way in helping\nachieve [maximum
  developer efficiency]... aka buying beer :P\n\n[maximum developer efficiency]: http://xkcd.com/323/\n\n##
  Limitations\n\nNote that there are restrictions that have been placed on the Komodo
  IDE\nPersonal license, see below:\n* we are only offering this special Personal
  license for a limited time\n* a company cannot reimburse you the cost of the license
  - companies should\n  purchase the enterprise Komodo IDE license\n* you cannot purchase
  an Upgrades and Support Subscription on this license\n* you cannot transfer your
  license to another owner\n\n## Features\n\nThere are no software changes - the personal
  license uses the same Komodo IDE\nsoftware, so you get [all the features] of Komodo
  IDE (multiple languages,\ndebugging, source code control), and you are able to use
  this license to develop\ncommercial software, just like you would with the enterprise
  Komodo IDE license.\n\n[all the features]: /features/\n\n## Enjoy\n\nWe hope you
  can take advantage of this special Komodo IDE Personal license and\nwe're glad we
  could offer it to you.\n\nIf you've got any questions, or feedback - please let
  us know.\n\n## PyCon in Montreal\n\nAlso, the Komodo team will be in Montreal next
  week (April 8-13), attending\nPyCon 2014. If you're at PyCon or in the general vicinity,
  then stop by the\nActiveState booth - we'll have lots of goodies to share with you.\n\n[PyCon
