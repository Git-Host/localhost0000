  25px 0\"><em>Macro Monday - a new macro to dig into every Monday!</em></h2>\n</div>\n\nSwap
  character order using the transpose macro.   Easily augmented to swap whole\nwords
  as well when word is selected.\n\n## Character Swapping with Transpose\n\nAn obscure
  but often useful (when you get used to it) tool I've encounter in a\nfew places
  is the [Transpose tool](http://web.mit.edu/gnu/doc/html/features_7.html#SEC54).\nIn
  it's most basic form, it swaps the positions of the character at the current\ncaret
  position and the next character in the line.\n\nYou can easily add more functionality
  by detecting a selection using ```ko.view.manager.currentView.scimoz.selectionEmpty```\nand
  transposing whole words instead of characters.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install
  the macro simply hit the \"View Resource\" button below, for instructions\non how
  to install it refer to the [Install Resources Documentation](http://komodoide.com/resources/install-instructions/#pane-macro).\n\n<a
  href=\"http://komodoide.com/resources/macros/cgchoffman--transpose/\" class=\"button
  primary\">\n    <i class=\"icon icon-eye\"></i>\n    View Resource\n</a>\n\n## Usage\n\nTo
  use the macro, make an editor selection and then invoke the macro - by\ndouble-clicking
  on the macro in the toolbox, using the Invoke Tool\n(Ctrl+Shift+K) to search/execute
  \"img tag dimensions\", or assigning your own\nkeybinding to the macro.  Click on
  the link below and have a look at the source\nfor yourself.\n"
