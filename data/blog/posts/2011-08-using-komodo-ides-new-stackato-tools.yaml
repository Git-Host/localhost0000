:body: ! "\n<div>\n  \t\t\n          <p>We've been <a href=\"http://www.activestate.com/blog/2011/07/stackato-now-officially-beta-come-create-your-own-private-paas-our-cloud-platform\">writing
  a fair bit</a> about <a href=\"http://www.activestate.com/cloud\">Stackato</a> recently,
  but mostly with IT managers and sysadmins in mind. We thought it was time to evangelize
  a bit to the Komodo community. Since it's <em>developers</em> who will be the day-to-day
  users of this platform, we'd like to get you involved a bit more and hear your feedback.</p>\n
  \ \n  <p>We've just released Komodo 7 Alpha 4 (<a href=\"http://docs.activestate.com/komodo/7.0/releases/ide.html\">release
  notes</a>). If you look in the right sidebar, you'll see a new Stackato Tools toolbox
  with some interesting looking macros. These are there to help you deploy, update,
  and manage Perl, Python, Ruby, and Node applications on Stackato.</p>\n  \n  <a
  rel=\"shadowbox[Screenshots]\" href=\"http://activestate.com/sites/default/files/assets/images/misc/stackato-tools.png\">\n
  \      <img title=\"Stackato Toolbox\" alt=\"Stackato Toolbox\" style=\"width: auto;
  float: right\" src=\"/assets/images/blog/2011-08/stackato-tools.png\" class=\"as_feature_img
  as_right\"></a>\n  \n  <p>To use these, you'll need to do a few things:</p>\n  \n
  \ <ol>\n  <li>Get <a href=\"http://downloads.activestate.com/Komodo/releases/7.0.0a4/\">Komodo
  IDE 7.0 Alpha 4</a>\n  </li>\n    <li>Get access to Stackato Beta by filling out
  the form on the <a href=\"http://www.activestate.com/cloud\">Stackato home page</a>.</li>\n
  \   <li>Install the 'stackato' client. This can be installed with 'pypm install
  stackato' or downloaded from the <a href=\"http://community.activestate.com/stackato\">Stackato
  Beta section of the Community site</a>.</li>\n    <li>Get and set-up a Stackato
  micro-cloud or cluster. For most people this will be just downloading and starting
  a Stackato VM for VMWarePlayer/Fusion or VirtualBox.</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>There's
  a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fezAKWSTUuw#t=5m12s\">demo</a> in a screencast
  from a previous post that will give you an idea what's involved. In the screencast
  I use the stackato command-line client, but once you've got the client set up in
  the Komodo preferences, you can start using the Stackato toolbox in Komodo IDE instead.</p>\n
  \ \n  <p>There are <em>lots</em> of commands available in the toolbox, and you'll
  probably end up using some more than others (e.g. start, stop, update, crashlogs).
  For these, you can create your own <a href=\"http://docs.activestate.com/komodo/7.0/tutorial/tourlet_custtoolbar.html#custtoolbar_top\">custom
  toolbar</a>, <a href=\"http://docs.activestate.com/komodo/7.0/tutorial/tourlet_keybinding.html#keybinding_top\">custom
  keybindings</a>, or use \"Invoke Tool\" (Ctrl+Shift+K) to run it by name.</p>\n
  \  \n  <p>Komodo 7 is still Alpha software, so things will change. There's currently
  no '<code>stackato target ...</code>' macro, so you'll need to do that from the
  command line. Likewise, some of the macros call up interactive sessions that are
  also handled in a console rather than in Komodo natively.</p>\n  \n  <p>Let us know
  what you think! Post your feedback on Stackato itself in the <a href=\"http://community.activestate.com/forum/stackato/feedback\">Stackato
  Feedback forum</a>, and feedback on Komodo 7 Alpha in the <a href=\"http://community.activestate.com/forums/komodo/komodo-beta\">Komodo
  Beta forum</a>.</p>\n</div>\n"
