:body: ! "\nWe've overhauled the website, we've overhauled the forums, and now --
  we're overhauling\nthe \"addon directory\", now called the \"Resources\" section.
  The Resources section\ndoes not just list addons, it shows you any type of Resource
  that will facilitate\nyour work with Komodo; addons, macros, snippets, languages,
  skins, etc.\n\n## Beta\n\nIt's worth noting that the new Resources section is still
  in Beta, there is still\na lot more we want to do with it but we want to allow the
  community to weigh in\non how we proceed, so please - [let yourself be heard][forum]
  if you have any\nideas / strong opinions and keep in mind - there *will be* bugs.\n\nAlso
  note that because it is still in beta you will not be able to access the\nKomodo
  Resources from within the Komodo addon manager. We will flip the switch\non this
  in the near future.\n\n## Submitting Resources\n\nThe Komodo Resources section utilizes
  github, you can simply submit your github\nrepository URL to the [Komodo-Resources
  repo] and our importer will take care of the\nrest. For detailed instructions please
  refer to the [How To Contribute page].\n\n## The Future\n\nAs I said we have many
  plans for the Resources section, in particular we will be\nfocussing on;\n\n * Importing
  from GitHub gists\n * Hooking into the Komodo addon manager \n * Adding statistics
  (top addons, resources, developers, etc)\n * etc.\n\nAgain, if you have ideas you'd
  like to share - [please let us know][forum]!\n\n   [forum]: http://forum.komodoide.com/category/customization\n
