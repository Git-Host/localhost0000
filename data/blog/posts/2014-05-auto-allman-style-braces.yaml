:body: ! "\n<div class=\"centered\">\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 300; margin: 10px 0
  25px 0\"><em>Macro Monday - a new macro to dig into every Monday!</em></h2>\n</div>\n\nKomodo
  does not dictate any sort of coding style, it merely facilitates you to\ncode whichever
  way you want. It's easy to code in [Allman style], but we can make\nit even easier
  with a simple macro.\n\nEssentially what this macro does is turn;\n\n<div class=\"centered\">\n
  \   <img src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-05/braces-default.gif\" style=\"vertical-align:
  middle\">\n    into\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-05/braces-allman.gif\"
  style=\"vertical-align: middle\">\n</div>\n\nTyping speed aside in these gifs, the
  productivity gain here is one less keypress.\nIt won't make a huge difference but
  it's the little things that make you more\nproductive.\n\nIn case it's not clear
  what is happening in those gifs, normally when you would\nwant to write in allman
  step you would essentially go through the following steps\n\n```c\nwhile (0)\n{\n```\n\nThe
  second I type the opening brace Komodo auto completes it to\n\n```c\nwhile (0)\n{|}\n```\n\nWhere
  \"|\" represents the cursor. Then when I press enter I get:\n\n```c\nwhile (0)\n{\n
  \   |\n}\n```\n\nThis works great, but we can make it even shorter (without resorting
  to snippets),\nwhat if I could just write the following\n\n```c\nwhile (0) {\n```\n\nAnd
  the second I type the opening brace it auto-completes to Allman style indentation?\nThat
  is basically what this macro does.\n\nCurrently this macro is still very experimental
  and will likely have a few bugs\nthat need to be worked out. Hopefully we'll be
  able to include it as a native\nfeature in Komodo 9.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install
  the macro simply hit the \"View Resource\" and \"Install Instructions\"\nlinks below.
  You'll want to hook the macro up to the \"On Startup\" trigger.\n\n<div class=\"centered\">\n
  \   <div class=\"spacer\"></div>\n    <a href=\"http://komodoide.com/resources/macros/naatan--autoallmanbraces/\"
  class=\"button big primary\">\n        <i class=\"icon icon-eye\"></i>\n        View
  Resource\n    </a>\n    <div class=\"spacer-half\"></div>\n    <span>\n        <i
  class=\"icon icon-question\"></i>\n        <a href=\"http://komodoide.com/resources/install-instructions/#pane-macro\"
  target=\"_blank\">Install Instructions</a>\n    </span>\n</div>\n\n## Usage\n\nSimply
  start typing! Provided that you have triggered the macro (either via the\nstartup
  event or by manually invoking it) it will automatically complete your\ncurly braces
  to [Allman style].\n\n## Credits\n\nThanks to [@woodpile] from the [Komodo Forums]
