  230px; height: 174px;\">We have officially shipped Komodo IDE/Edit 8.0, and are
  now getting a bit of bandwidth after responding to the overwhelming feedback --
  bandwidth being the operative word after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ActiveState/status/309727121343930368\"
  target=\"_blank\">one of our servers was nearly brought to a halt</a> from Komodo
  downloads!</p>\n  <p>We had a feeling that this release would go over well. Komodo
  8.0 has a lot of major features and revisions that our users have been requesting
  for a very long time. I'm proud to say that we've delivered, and that you'll really
  like what we've come up with.</p>\n  <h3>What's New in 8.0</h3>\n  <ul>\n  <li>\n
  \ <strong>User Interface Styling</strong>: Redesigned to be lighter and feel native
  for each platform</li>\n  <li>\n  <strong>Floating Side Panes</strong>: Undock components
  and move them anywhere on screen</li>\n  <li>\n  <strong>Open Files Side Pane</strong>:
  Organizes all your open files by language</li>\n  <li>\n  <strong>Minimap</strong>:
  Reposition anywhere from a high-level view</li>\n  <li>\n  <strong>Fast Open Shortcuts</strong>:
  Create shortcuts to long file and directory paths</li>\n  <li>\n  <strong>Auto Abbreviations</strong>:
  You can now type abbreviations to trigger a selection of snippets</li>\n  </ul>\n
  \ <p>More on our website, with screenshots:</p>\n  <p><a href=\"http://activestate.com/komodo-ide/whats-new\"
  target=\"_blank\">http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide/whats-new</a></p>\n  <h3>What
  We Wanted to Achieve</h3>\n  <p>There were two aspects of Komodo that we really
  wanted to sink our teeth into, excuse the pun.</p>\n  <p>First, we had always wanted
  to make changes to the user interface. While we have kept adding new functionality
  and components to Komodo over the years, the UI had grown a bit unweildy. It was
  time to streamline it, and also make it feel more consistent with each user's operating
  system.</p>\n  <p>Secondly, we wanted to make it as quick and easy to navigate code
  as possible. Komodo has always been known as a fast IDE, but we could always do
  better. With that goal in mind, we designed the <a href=\"http://activestate.com/sites/default/files/komodo8/ss/new/openfiles.png\"
  target=\"_blank\">Open Files Side Pane</a>, <a href=\"http://activestate.com/sites/default/files/komodo8/ss/new/fastopen-shortcut.png\"
  target=\"_blank\">Fast Open Shortcuts</a> and the high-level <a href=\"http://activestate.com/sites/default/files/komodo8/ss/new/minimap.png\"
  target=\"_blank\">Minimap</a> scroll area.</p>\n  <p>Overall, we've found the right
  balance of new and classic. Current and past users will be pleased that it still
  codes like Komodo but feels more flexible and efficient than before.</p>\n  <h3>Promotional
  Pricing</h3>\n  <p>At the expense of sounding like a marketing person (and a poor
  one at that), Komodo IDE is on sale now until March 31.</p>\n  <ul>\n  <li>\n  <strong><font
  color=\"red\">$245</font></strong> for new licenses (regular price $295)</li>\n
  \ <li>\n  <strong><font color=\"red\">$136</font></strong> to upgrade from version
  7 (regular price $168)</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>I do recommend adding an annual Upgrades
  and Support subscription for these reasons:</p>\n  <ul>\n  <li>It's only $87 annually
  to keep current with the latest release (instead of the $136 upgrade).</li>\n  <li>You'll
  get priority support from our friendly ActiveState folks.</li>\n  <li>If you're
  upgrading from version 7, there is a bigger discount when you add the Upgrades &amp;
  Support option (basically comes to $69 this year instead of $87).</li>\n  </ul>\n
  \ <p>To buy a new license, <a href=\"http://store.activestate.com\" target=\"_blank\">visit
  our store</a>. To upgrade, sign in to your <a href=\"https://account.activestate.com/\"
  target=\"_blank\">\"My Account\" page</a>.</p>\n  <p>But enough of that.</p>\n  <h3>Get
  the Bits!</h3>\n  <p>Download the installers here:</p>\n  <p>IDE trial: <a href=\"http://activestate.com/komodo-ide/downloads\"

  \ <p>To all current Komodo users, we hope you enjoy this release. And for newcomers,
  we are happy to welcome you to the club -- the download server's working just fine
  now.</p>\n  <p>Cheers!</p>\n</div>\n"
