:body: ! "\n<div class=\"centered\">\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 300; margin: 10px 0
  25px 0\"><em>Macro Monday - a new macro to dig into every Monday!</em></h2>\n</div>\n\nLet's
  say you have the following snippet of html:\n```html\n<strong>This text is bold</strong>\n```\nWith
  this macro you can simply put your cursor anywhere within the node contents 'and
  execute the macro to select the contents of the node (ie. the text).\n\nThis macro
  is very plain and fairly dumb, it will likely not be able to select\ncomplex values
  (eg. sub-nodes). It currently only covers html \"braces\" (ok,\ntechnically not
  braces), but support for other delimiters should be relatively\neasy to add and
  is something I originally intended to include (hence the name),\nand will likely
  add soon.\n\nFeel free to fork and extend.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the
  macro simply hit the \"View Resource\" and \"Install Instructions\"\nlinks below.
  You'll want to hook the macro up to the \"On Startup\" trigger.\n\n<div class=\"centered\">\n
  \   <div class=\"spacer\"></div>\n    <a href=\"http://komodoide.com/resources/macros/naatan--selectbracecontents/\"
  class=\"button big primary\">\n        <i class=\"icon icon-eye\"></i>\n        View
  Resource\n    </a>\n    <div class=\"spacer-half\"></div>\n    <span>\n        <i
  class=\"icon icon-question\"></i>\n        <a href=\"http://komodoide.com/resources/install-instructions/#pane-macro\"
  target=\"_blank\">Install Instructions</a>\n    </span>\n</div>\n\n## Share Your
  Own Awesome Macros\n\nDo you have your own awesome macro's that you think others
  could benefit from?\nSubmit them to the [Resources Section] and if you really want
  to get it noticed\n[write a Macro Monday blog about it][macromonday].\n\n   [Resources
  Section]: /resources/submit-instructions/#pane-resources\n   [macromonday]: /resources/submit-instructions/#pane-blogs\n"
