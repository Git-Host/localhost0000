  25px 0\"><em>Macro Monday - a new macro to dig into every Monday!</em></h2>\n</div>\n\nQuickly
  add image dimensions to an `<img>` tag based off the image tags src\nattribute.
  Everyone wants it, now you've got it.\n\n## The Things I Need\n\nHow often have
  you entered an image tags src attribute and thought \"GO!... Fill it\nin... Please..\"?
  I know I have. At least twice.\n\nOthers have had similar thoughts and one such
  user [requested this of Komodo](http://community.activestate.com/forum/html-editing-img-tag-expansion-etc#comment-6695)\nsome
  time ago.  EricP answered the call and gave the user something that worked.\n\nIt
  uses the [Image() object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Canvas_tutorial/Using_images#Creating_an_image_from_scratch)\nin
  Javascript that allows us to load the image then pulls some information\nfrom it
  and use it to append *height* and *width* attributes to the image tag\nyou're working
  in.\n\nI've updated it to use the *load* event to be sure the image is ready when
  I pull\nproperties off of it.  I've also created a full path for the image which\n[ToddW](http://komodoide.com/authors/#ToddWhiteman)
  says will bite me in the @$$ later but only time will tell.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo
  install the macro simply hit the \"View Resource\" button below, for instructions\non
  how to install it refer to the [Install Resources Documentation](http://komodoide.com/resources/install-instructions/#pane-macro).\n\n<a
  href=\"http://komodoide.com/resources/macros/cgchoffman--imgtagdimensions/\" class=\"button
  primary\">\n    <i class=\"icon icon-eye\"></i>\n    View Resource\n</a>\n\n## Usage\n\nTo
  use the macro, make an editor selection and then invoke the macro - by\ndouble-clicking
  on the macro in the toolbox, using the Invoke Tool\n(Ctrl+Shift+K) to search/execute
  \"img tag dimensions\", or assigning your own\nkeybinding to the macro.  Click on
  the link below and have a look at the source\nfor yourself.\n"
