  target=\"_blank\">Stackato 2.4</a> and <a href=\"http://www.drdobbs.com/joltawards/jolt-awards-coding-tools/240147989?pgno=4\">Komodo
  7.1 IDE</a>&#160;were named Dr. Dobbs 2013 Jolt Awards&#160;finalists in the \"Coding
  Tools\" category. The Coding Tools awards showcase the best IDEs and most innovative
  coding tools that \"jolt\" the software industry and make it easier, faster, and
  more efficient to create software.</p>\n  <p>Commenting on Stackato 2.4, one of
  the judges, Gary Evans, writes that the \"enhancements to Cloud Foundry made by
  ActiveState are impressive.\" Among key features, Evans lists multiple additional
  languages, Virtual Appliance deployment, Management Console, and more. \"What's
  not to like here?\" he concludes.</p>\n  <p>Judge Mike Riley was equally impressed
  with Komodo's IDE. \"Its cross-platform commitment is hard to beat,\" he notes.
  \"Komodo is the best IDE I've used to write Perl, Python, and Ruby scripts and Web
  applications,\" Riley says. \"I feel instantly at home and productive regardless
  of what OS I'm running it on.\" Among some features Riley highlights are Komody
  Sync, broad language support, and a new built-in code profiling tool for Python
  and PHP.</p>\n  <p>Congrats to Coding Tools category co-winners MS Visual Studio
  and JetBrains -- it is an honor worth acknowledging. But of course, it's an honor
  just to be nominated!</p>\n</div>\n"
