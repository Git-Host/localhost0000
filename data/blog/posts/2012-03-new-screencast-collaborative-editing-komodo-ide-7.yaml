  alt=\"Komodo IDE: Code Collaboration\"></a> \n  \n  We've been remiss in making
  screencasts for all the new features in Komodo IDE 7. To remedy that, <a href=\"http://www.activestate.com/blog/authors/toddw\">Todd
  Whiteman</a> has made this short video showing off <a href=\"http://docs.activestate.com/komodo/7.0/collab.html\">Komodo
  Collaboration</a>. You can share buffers (existing files or new documents) with
  other Komodo IDE users in real time and see everyone's changes highlighted and tracked.
  This is similar to the functionality available in online tools like Google Docs
  or <a href=\"https://github.com/pita/etherpad-lite\">Etherpad lite</a>, but with
  all of the editing and code intelligence features available in Komodo.</p>\n  \n
  \ <p>This new feature gives you:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>real time editing</li>\n
  \     <li>the ability to share with individual users and/or limit access to individual
  files</li>\n      <li>visual indicators for where people are editing and the text
  they have highlighted</li>\n      <li>secure HTTPS/SSL connections - only authorized
  users can see the code you share</li>\n      <li>full Komodo editing support - commands,
  code coloring, syntax highlighting, etc...</li>\n      <li>unlimited collaborators
  - how many friends ya got?</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h2>Pair programming</h2>\n  \n  <p>When
  ActiveState was a part of <a href=\"http://www.sophos.com/en-us/\">Sophos</a>, the
  PureMessage team made the big jump to adopting the Agile methodology and using pair
  programming. This involved a big change in the office layout to accommodate pairing
  stations, where developers could sit side-by-side and work on code collaboratively.
  Each station needed two keyboards, two mice, two chairs, and the corresponding desk
  real-estate. That would be an unfeasible change for a team that just wants to experiment
  with pair programming or use it only sporadically.</p>\n  \n  <p>With Komodo Collaboration,
  you can get some of the benefits of pair programming without having to rearrange
  your furniture. You can still grab your laptop and go sit with your colleague, but
  you don't have to fight about who's key-bindings are going to be used (the Vim vs.
  Emacs issue for example) or give up any editor customizations you've made (theme,
  macros, snippets, etc.).</p>\n   \n  <h2>Distributed development teams</h2>\n  \n
  \ <p>Most distributed teams of remote developers become adept at communicating via
  email or IRC and using pastebins to pass code back and forth, but working together
  in the same buffer is much more efficient. With code collaboration in the editor,
  pair programming suddenly becomes a possibility. With Komodo, a headset, and Skype,
  you get pretty much the full pairing experience without having to put on pants.

  class=\"as_feature_img as_left\"></a>\n  \n  <h2 style=\"clear:both\">How it works</h2>\n
  \ \n  <p>Behind the scenes, here's how collaboration in Komodo IDE communicates
  with the central server hosted in ActiveState's network:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>Komodo
  IDE connects to the ActiveState server over HTTPS</li>\n      <li>Users are authenticated
  using their ActiveState single sign-on account</li>\n      <li>Shared files are
  stored on the ActiveState server. </li>\n      <li>Changes made by users are propagated
  to the ActiveState server</li>\n      <li>The ActiveState server then re-propogates
  those changes to other authenticated users accessing that file</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>So
  <a href=\"http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide/downloads\">try it out</a> and let
  us know what you think.</p>\n  \n  <p>If you like what you see, note that <strong><a
  href=\"https://store.activestate.com/komodo-ide\">Komodo IDE is on sale till March
  31</a></strong>.</p>\n  \n  \n  <p style=\"clear:both\"></p>\n</div>\n"
