  25px 0\"><em>Macro Monday - a new macro to dig into every Monday!</em></h2>\n</div>\n\nI
  came across a macro that Eric Promislow had written a few years ago that seemed\npretty
  interesting, [How do you write to the Command Output Window](http://community.activestate.com/faq/how-do-you-write-command-output-window)?\nIts
  a bit out dated since Mark Yen added customizable tab layouts but that was an\neasy
  fix.  All tabs are now their own widgets so to access their attributes you\nhave
  to retrieve the widget first.  That's basically the only change I had to make\nto
  Eric's version.\n\nI also added some commented code you'll notice.  There are a
  few ways this macro\ncould be useful but the most useful would be to be used by
  other macros that have\noutput.  As it stands, you would set this macro up to run
  at Komodo startup.\nThat would add the new function to the live code base and allow
  you to use it by\ncallig it from other macros that may want to print to the output
  pane.\n\nYou could also run it manually and have it ask you for input.  I don't
  know\nwhy you would do this but I'm not you and you're great so you can do whatever\nyou
  want.  You would uncomment lines 16 through 18 and line 49.  Hopefully those\nline
  numbers are still relevant when you're reading this ;)\n\n## Installation\n\nTo
  install the macro simply hit the \"View Resource\" and \"Install Instructions\"\nlinks
  below.\n\n<div class=\"centered\">\n    <div class=\"spacer\"></div>\n    <a href=\"/resources/macros/cgchoffman--printtooutputpane/\"
  class=\"button big primary\">\n        <i class=\"icon icon-eye\"></i>\n        View
  Resource\n    </a>\n    <div class=\"spacer-half\"></div>\n    <span>\n        <i
  class=\"icon icon-question\"></i>\n        <a href=\"http://komodoide.com/resources/install-instructions/#pane-macro\"
  target=\"_blank\">Install Instructions</a>\n    </span>\n</div>\n\n## Share Your
  Own Macros\n\nHave you written your own macros that you think others could benefit
  from?\nSubmit them to the [Resources Section] and if you really want to get it noticed\n[write
  a Macro Monday blog about it][macromonday].\n\n   [Resources Section]: /resources/submit-instructions/#pane-resources\n
