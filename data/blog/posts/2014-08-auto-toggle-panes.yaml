:body: ! "\n<div class=\"centered\">\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 300; margin: 10px 0
  25px 0\"><em>Macro Monday - a new macro to dig into every Monday!</em></h2>\n</div>\n\nI
  like to use Komodo without any panes or tabs showing - just the editor.\nNormally
  I would use keybindings to toggle the relevant panes when I need them\nbut I wanted
  something more intuitive; so I wrote a macro.\n\nWhenever you want to use your panes
  you move your mouse towards them to perform\nan action, so I figured - why not toggle
  my panes automatically whenever I\nmove my mouse towards them. That's exactly what
  the macro I wrote aims to do.\n\nThere are still some caveats, for example it currently
  tends to trigger when\nyou are simply trying to place a breakpoint. I have some
  ideas on how to fix this\nand will likely be releasing an update for this later
  on, but for now it is\nalready quite usable. I am using it fulltime myself.\n\n##
  Installation\n\nTo install the macro simply hit the \"View Resource\" and \"Install
  Instructions\"\nlinks below.\n\n<div class=\"centered\">\n    <div class=\"spacer\"></div>\n
  \   <a href=\"http://komodoide.com/resources/macros/naatan--autotogglepanes/\" class=\"button
  big primary\">\n        <i class=\"icon icon-eye\"></i>\n        View Resource\n
  \   </a>\n    <div class=\"spacer-half\"></div>\n    <span>\n        <i class=\"icon
  icon-question\"></i>\n        <a href=\"http://komodoide.com/resources/install-instructions/#pane-macro\"
  target=\"_blank\">Install Instructions</a>\n    </span>\n</div>\n\n## Share Your
  Own Macros\n\nHave you written your own macros that you think others could benefit
