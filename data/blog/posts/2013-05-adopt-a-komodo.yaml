  style=\"width: 232px; height: 130px;\">This month, ActiveState is running a Komodo
  IDE fundraiser. <strong>$50 of each license sold</strong> of Komodo IDE or ActivePerl/Tcl
  Pro Studio will go towards efforts for the <strong>conservation of endangered species</strong>
  such as the Komodo Dragon.</p>\n  <p>As a thank you gift, each customer will receive
  a gift bag containing an official certificate and an <strong>awesome Komodo plushie</strong>!</p>\n

  0px; margin-top: 0px;\">Why the Promotion?</h3>\n  <p>The Komodo Dragon is a marvel
  of nature. It is the world's largest living species of lizard, and one of the last
  surviving species of megafauna from the Pleistocene.</p>\n  <p>Given this level
  of awesomeness, we couldn't help but adopt the Komodo at ActiveState as a powerful
  symbol for our products. But that association also warrants a recognition of the
  importance of the natural world, and how it still resonates with us even as a technological
  skilled society.</p>\n  <p>Indeed, as a company of developers, we have a tendency
  to appreciate the natural world through our various pursuits in photography, astronomy
  or even a general interest in scientific discovery.</p>\n  <p>For that reason, surely
  we can contribute a small sum of our fortunes for a worthy cause: the preservation
  of mighty creatures that inspire our imagination and drive to innovate.</p>\n  <h3>How
  Does It Work?</h3>\n  <p>It's easy!</p>\n  <ol>\n  <li>\n  <a href=\"https://store.activestate.com/komodo-ide\"

  their kit, but we're willing to extend it based on demand.</p>\n  <p>So there you
