  <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide/downloads\">Komodo
  IDE 7.1</a> is out! I've put together a short screencast to demo all the great <a
  target=\"_new\" href=\"http://docs.activestate.com/komodo/7.1/\">new features</a>
  we've added.</p>\n  \n  <p>Here's a summary of what I cover in the video.</p>\n
  \ \n  <h2>Variable Highlighting</h2>\n  \n  <p>First off, we've added variable highlighting.
  When you click on a variable, all the other instances of that variable are highlighted,
  making it easy to track where your variables are being used in a particular function.</p>\n
  \ \n  <h2>DVCS Push</h2>\n  \n  <p>We've also <a target=\"_new\" title=\"Komodo
  Docs: Push Dialog\" href=\"http://docs.activestate.com/komodo/7.1/scc.html#push_dialog\">improved
  support</a> for distributed version control systems: Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar.
  You can now 'push' your changes back to the repository. In the video example using
  Git, I make a change, commit it and push it. The new interface gives you the option
  to choose the branch you want to push to, as well as the tags.</p>\n  \n  <h2>Debugging
  in Stackato</h2>\n  \n  <p>Stackato integration has been enhanced with the ability
  to <a target=\"_new\" title=\"Debugging with Stackato\" href=\"http://docs.activestate.com/komodo/7.1/stackato.html#debugging_applications\">debug
  applications</a> within a cloud environment. From the Stackato dialogue option,
  you simply choose \"Configure Debugger\" and set it to work on the Komodo host name
  and port number.</p>\n  \n  <h2>Adding your own language</h2>\n  \n  <p>We've made
  it really easy to <a target=\"_new\" title=\"http://docs.activestate.com/komodo/7.1/extensions.html#language_extensions\"
  href=\"http://docs.activestate.com/komodo/7.1/extensions.html#language_extensions\">add
  support for new languages</a>. For example, in this video I create a Go extension
  within a few minutes. You start a new project from a template, set handling of line
  and block comments, copy &amp; paste keywords, and Komodo creates the package information.
  Click \"Build and Install\" in your toolbox, restart Komodo, and Go support (syntax
  highlighting and keyword autocompletion) is up and running.</p>\n  \n  <h2>Updates</h2>\n
  \ \n  <p>Finally, we've upgraded support for the newest versions of existing languages:
  PHP 5.4, Node.js 0.8, Ruby 1.9.3, Python 3.3 and Perl 5.16.</p>\n</div>\n"
