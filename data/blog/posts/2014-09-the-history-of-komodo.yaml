  released roughly 14 years ago. This means Komodo\nis older than some of its users..
  and yet its held up remarkably well. Yes\nit was starting to show signs of aging,
  but Komodo 8 came with some age-reversing\nserum so this dragon isn't going anywhere.\n\nFor
  a while now I've been wanting to set up some virtual machines and\nrun through all
  of the Komodo versions since its initial launch. Now I finally\ngot to do just that;
  and to get the full authentic experience of what Komodo\nfelt like when each version
  was released I ran it on the target platform of its\ntime, which means I installed
  Windows 98 - oh the nostalgia.\n\n<hr id=\"0.x\">\n<small><a href=\"#top\" class=\"push-right\">Back
  to Top</a></small>\n\n## Version 0.x - 2000 to 2001\n\nKomodo was [first announced
  on May 24th 2000][1], but the [first version was not released\nuntil (approximately)
  Nov 9th 2000][2]. Back then Firefox did not even exist yet,\nKomodo was based on
  the Mozilla framework and browser which would later essentially\nbecome Firefox.\n\nThe
  first version looked very bare bones, but that was normal for the software\nof that
  time. What amazed me most about the first version was that it had an Open Files\nwidget
  (like we re-introduced in Komodo 8) but it had no file explorer. You\nopened files
  by using your OS file browser or a file open dialog. The file\nexplorer wasn't introduced
  until much later.\n\nSome other interesting features in the first version of Komodo
  were:\n\n - It came packaged with the Mozilla browser and ChatZilla (!!)\n - You
  could \"collapse\" the menubar, but even collapsed it still took up about\n   as
  much space\n - There was no Preference window yet, you could only adjust your preferences\n
  \  through the menubar.\n - It already came with Perl and Python debugging\n - It
  installed to C:\\Komodo\n\n<div class=\"lightbox-group centered\" data-title=\"Komodo

  Version 1.x - 2001 to 2002\n\nVersion 1.x already looked significantly different
  from 0.x and no longer came\npackaged with a browser or chat client. The UI reminded
  me a lot of earlier\nversions of MS Word, not too unsurprising considering it's
  essentially a text\neditor of sorts.\n\nNotable 1.x changes were\n\n - LOTS of polish
  over the 0.x version\n - Preferences introduced, already looks a lot like the Preferences
  dialog we have\n   today, though not as populated.\n - Support for FTP servers\n
  - Introduced the first version of the Rx tookit\n\n<div class=\"lightbox-group centered\"

  GUI builder? No? Neither did I until I installed Komodo\n2.x. Evidently Komodo used
  to [support building GUI elements for Tk and Tkinter][4].\nThis wasn't something
  slapped on either, the GUI builder was an incredibly\ndetailed and complete component.
  So much so that when ActiveState stopped\ndeveloping it for various reasons it was
  open sourced and the community took\ncharge of it, it was rebranded as SpecTcl and
  is [still available on SourceForge\ntoday][3].\n\nOther notable 2.x changes included:\n\n
  - Linux Version (Version 2.3)\n - Solaris Version (!) (Version 2.5)\n - Color Scheme
  Editor\n - Introduced the Toolbox (macros, snippets, etc)\n - Source Code Control\n
  - GUI Builder\n - Visual Package Manager\n - HTML Previewing\n\n<div class=\"lightbox-group

  look more and more like the Komodo we see today,\nthe UI and UX started to establish
  itself more clearly. With Komodo 3 we\nintroduced one of the most important features
  in Komodo today - CodeIntel.\nThis first version required manual input, where you
  would select which\nlanguages CodeIntel should control on first startup, after which
  Komodo would\nrun through the first scan. This is all still being done but is mostly
  moved\ninto the background such that you aren't needlessly bothered by it.\n\nNotable
  3.x changes included:\n\n - OSX Version (Komodo 3.5)\n - CodeIntel\n - Interactive
  Shell (REPL)\n - Code Browser\n - Open / Find Toolbar\n - Custom toolbars, menus
  and icons\n\nKomodo was more and more becoming the full fledged IDE we know and
  love today,\nbut it was still missing a file explorer.\n\n<div class=\"lightbox-group

  Explorer, or as we tend to call it; \"Places\". Komodo 4\ndidn't do much about its
  UI, it instead focussed entirely on functionality.\n\nNotable changes were:\n\n
  - Go to Definition\n - API Catalogs\n - DOM Viewer Widget\n - Code Browser Widget\n
  - Vi Emulation\n - HTTP Inspector\n - JS Debugging through a JavaScript DBGP browser
  extension\n - SFTP and SCP Support\n - SCC Changes List\n\nAs you can see whilst

  to the cloud, such that their preferences would remain the\nsame between multiple

  UI as I had always felt that Komodo needed a good looking\nUI to match its powerful
  feature set. As a result Komodo 8 looks significantly\ndifferent from its earlier
  versions, introducing a completely new monochrome\niconset and skin. The skinning
  system was built using modern web technologies\nand is available for anyone to use.\n\nOther
  notable changes included:\n\n - Minimap Scrollbar\n - Customizable panes/widgets\n

  id=\"14ycommits\"></a>\n## 14 Years of Commits\n\nMark Yen, one of the Komodo developers,
  experimented with [gource][8] a while ago\nto get a representation of the work we've
  done over 14 years. The result isn't\nreally useful in any way, but it sure is cool
  to look at.\n\n<div class=\"centered\">\n<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/105804003\"
  width=\"500\" height=\"330\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen
  allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n14 years of commits spanning 3 version control
  systems (perforce, svn and git)\nand more committers than I care to count.\n\n<a
  id=\"back\"></a>\n## Looking Back\n\nI've used Komodo for a long time, though I
  honestly cannot recall what year or\nversion I started with.. it must have been
  version 4.x or 5.x. It's funny looking\nback through our changelogs and seeing so
  many vital features being introduced\nsince the time I started using Komodo; it
  makes me wonder how on earth I was\nable to use Komodo without feature X and Y.
  But then again, like many programmers\nI started out in Notepad (I kid you not)
  so it's all relative.\n\nAs you may have been able to tell I looked at the history
  of Komodo mainly from\nUI and UX perspective, I did not spend a lot of time with
  individual features.\nIf you would like to play around with earlier versions of
  Komodo yourself you\ncan easily do so by [visiting our Download Archive][7].\n\n<a
  id=\"forward\"></a>\n## Looking Forward\n\nFor all the changes Komodo has gone through
  it is sometimes surprising we still\nhave stuff to work on; but we do - for all
  the changes you see on these pages we\nhave a thousand more in our minds. Komodo
  9 will showcase some of the brightest\nof those ideas but we've got plenty more
  for another 14 years, and then some.\n\n   [1]: http://web.archive.org/web/20001009120307/http://www.activestate.com/Corporate/Media_Center/News/Press959150636.html\n
