:body: ! "\n<div>\n  \t\t\n               <img title=\"Node support in Komodo\" alt=\"Node
  support in Komodo\" style=\"width: auto\" src=\"/assets/images/blog/2011-06/node2.jpg\"
  class=\"as_feature_img as_left\"><p>After months of hearing the question \"When
  are you adding Node.js support to Komodo?\" I'm very pleased to announce that Node.js
  autocomplete and debugging are available in <a href=\"http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide/downloads\">Komodo
  IDE 7 Alpha 3</a>.</p>\n  \n  <h2 style=\"clear:both\">Code intelligence</h2>\n
  \      \n  <p style=\"float: left\">Tucked between JavaScript and Perl is a language
  preference pane for Node.js, where you can set the path to your <code>node</code>
  executable and add library search paths.</p>\n  \n  <img title=\"Komodo IDE: Node
  Settings\" alt=\"Komodo IDE: Node Settings\" style=\"width: auto; float: right;\"
  src=\"/assets/images/blog/2011-06/node-prefs.png\" class=\"as_feature_img as_right\"><p>Without
  any configuration, Komodo should find node if it's on your path, and give you autocompletion
  for everything in the core library. The recursive scanning of node library directories
  is not quite there yet, so you'll have to manually add the path of each npm module
  you want to use. Once you have, you'll get autocomplete for those third-party modules
  as well.</p>\n  \n  <p style=\"clear:both\">As far as I'm aware, Komodo is the first
  IDE to provide this feature for Node.</p>\n  \n    <img title=\"Komodo IDE: Node.js
  Autocomplete\" alt=\"Komodo IDE: Node.js Autocomplete\" style=\"width: auto\" src=\"/assets/images/blog/2011-06/node-autocomplete.png\"
  class=\"as_feature_img as_left\"><p>Komodo uses heuristicts (i.e. looking for things
  like '<code>require('foo')</code>' or '<code>#!/usr/bin/node</code>' in the file)
  to detect when a JavaScript file is actually Node.js. If for some reason you're
  not getting autocompletion in the Node namespaces, check the language detection
  panel of the status bar on the bottom right and override the detected language if
  necessary.</p>\n  \n  <h2>Debugging</h2>\n  \n  <p>We've also added Node debugging!</p>\n
  \ \n  <a rel=\"shadowbox[Screenshots]\" href=\"http://activestate.com/sites/default/files/blog_import_images/node-debug.png\">\n
  \      <img title=\"Komodo IDE: Node Debugging\" alt=\"Komodo IDE: Node Debugging\"
  style=\"width: auto\" src=\"/assets/images/blog/2011-06/node-debug-500.png\" class=\"as_feature_img
  as_left\"></a>\n  \n  <p>You can run and step through the code, set breakpoints,
  examine and edit variables, and all of the things you can do when debugging Python,
  PHP, Perl, Ruby or Tcl in Komodo.</p>\n  \n  <p>When starting the debugger, you
  may be prompted to create a <a href=\"http://docs.activestate.com/komodo/7.0/debugger.html#remote_uri_mapping\">mapped
  URI</a> for linking the URI provided by the debugger with the file system location
  (e.g. <code>file://127.0.0.1/path/to/file --&gt; file://path/to/file</code>), but
  once you save the mapping things should work fine. Like the recursive code intelligence
  scanning, we'll fix this so it all happens automatically in future releases.</p>\n
  \ \n  <h2>Stackato integration and movable panes</h2>\n  \n  <p>Along with the Node
  features, we've also fulfilled a very long standing feature request: the ability
  to move the tabs in the sidebars and bottom pane around. If you want to put the
  Toolbox in the left sidebar, and the Debugger in the right - go for it.</p>\n  \n
  \ <p>There's also integration with our cloud platform, <a href=\"http://www.activestate.com/cloud\">Stackato</a>.
  That takes a bit more explaining, so I'll make it the subject of it's own upcoming
  blog post.</p>\n  \n  <h2>Upgrades and support</h2>\n  \n  <p>For those of you who
  are torn between buying Komodo 6 now vs. waiting for the official Komodo 7 release,
  you can essentially get both (think of it as \"upgrade insurance\") by getting the
  <a href=\"http://www.activestate.com/upgrade-support-terms\">Upgrades &amp; Support
  subscription</a>. When Komodo 7 is released, you'll be good to go.</p>\n</div>\n"
