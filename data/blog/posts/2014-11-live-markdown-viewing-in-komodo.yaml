  we've been writing a\nlot more [Markdown] content. I personally like markdown (we
  actually write our\nblogs in Markdown too), it's simple text formatting makes it
  faster (for me) to\nwrite web-based content.\n\nNow, the only problem I was having
  with writing Markdown in Komodo, is that I\nhad to use an external tool to generate
  the HTML content in order for me to do a\nfinal verification.\n\nWith the addition
  of the [Markdown Viewer] add-on, this is no longer a problem!\nI can view the generated
  HTML directly within Komodo and the HTML preview will\nupdate itself whenever I
  make a change to the Markdown text - it doesn't even\nneed to be saved.\n\nThe Markdown
  preview uses GitHub styling (though we may make this optional in\nthe future, or
  support other markdown variants), so you should feel right at\nhome when writing
  Markdown inside of Komodo.\n\n## Features\n\n- A small Preview button appears in
  the top-right corner of the editor whenever\n  a Markdown file is open\n- Automatically
  closes the markdown preview when switching to another file,\n  re-opens when switching
  back\n- Allows side-by-side, or under-over previewing inside of Komodo\n- Dynamically
  updates the markdown preview as you edit (live editing)\n- Uses GitHub flavoured
  CSS styling\n- Styles code blocks inside of triple back quotes\n\n# Screenshot\n\n![Screenshot](https://github.com/Komodo/markdown-viewer/raw/master/screenshots/markdown-viewer.png)\n\n##
  Source Code\n\nThe code for the Markdown Viewer add-on is open-source at GitHub,
  in the Komodo\n[markdown-viewer] repository. We've love to hear from people trying
  the add-on, and\nhopefull we'll see contributions from other users.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo
  install the add-on simply hit the \"View Resource\" and \"Install Instructions\"\nlinks
  below.\n\nOnce the add-on is installed - just open a Markdown file and you should
  see a\n\"Preview\" button in the top-right corner.\n\n<div class=\"centered\">\n
