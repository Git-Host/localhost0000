:body: ! "\n<div>\n  \t\t\n          <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/OmFv19JzreI\"
  rel=\"shadowbox;width=640;height=530\" title=\"Komodo IDE and Stackato\">\n  \t<img
  class=\"as_left\" style=\"float:left\" alt=\"Komodo IDE and Stackato\" src=\"/assets/images/blog/2012-01/komodo-stackato-thumb.png\"
  width: height:></a>\n  \n  <p>I've been doing a lot of demos of <a href=\"http://www.activestate.com/cloud\">Stackato</a>
  lately and starting to incorporate the new <a href=\"http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide/downloads\">Komodo
  IDE 7</a> client interface (currently RC). Without further ado, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/OmFv19JzreI\"
  rel=\"shadowbox;width=640;height=530\" title=\"Komodo IDE and Stackato\">here's
  the screencast</a>!</p>\n  \n  <p>It was tough to decide what to show. Debugging
  applications running on the micro cloud is pretty cool but it's better demonstrated
  in a written tutorial (which I'll be writing up soon). Showing off the DB Explorer
  is a little more visually interesting.</p>\n  \n  <h2 style=\"clear:both\">DB Explorer,
  dbshell, and tunnel</h2>\n  \n  <p>As the screencast shows, it's extremely simple
  to connect to a locally running micro cloud from Komodo. That's because Komodo has
  integration with the <a href=\"http://activestate.com/blog/2011/11/connecting-database-services-stackato\">'stackato
  dbshell' command</a>, which has been part of the client for a while longer than
  the newer <a href=\"http://activestate.com/blog/2011/12/new-stackato-client-tunneling-and-https\">'tunnel'
  command</a>. Komodo will have better hooks into 'tunnel' in future releases, but
  for now, it's fairly trivial to set up a connection to the database manually as
  shown.</p>\n  \n  <h2 style=\"clear:both\">What you'll need to follow along</h2>\n
  \ \n  <p>If you'd like to try this all out for yourself, you'll need:</p>\n  <ul>\n
  \ <li>\n  <a href=\"http://community.activestate.com/stackato/download\">Stackato
  micro cloud VM</a>: There's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CunjLaS7Rzo\">another
  screencast</a> that shows how to get this set up. If your local system doesn't have
  the resources to run a VM, feel free to use the Stackato Sandbox instead.</li>\n
  \   <li>\n  <a href=\"http://community.activestate.com/stackato/download\">Stackato
  client</a>: Komodo uses this stand-alone executable in the background. You may need
  to do some minor <a href=\"http://docs.stackato.com/quick-start.html#stackato-client-setup\">client
  setup</a> after download.</li>\n    <li>\n  <a href=\"http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide/downloads\">Komodo
  IDE 7</a>: Download an RC build (or a trial of the release, depending on when you're
  reading this) and set the path to the 'stackato' executable in Komodo's Stackato
  preferences if it's not in your system $PATH.</li>\n    <li>\n  <a href=\"http://community.activestate.com/stackato/demos\">Sample
  apps</a>: We've put together a <a href=\"https://github.com/ActiveState/stackato-samples\">Github
  repo</a> full of sample applications in a variety of languages.</li>\n  </ul>\n
  \ <h2>Let us know what you think!</h2>\n  \n  <p>As always, we would like to hear
  your feedback on how this works for you, and what you would like to see in future
  releases. You can do that in the <a href=\"http://community.activestate.com/forum/stackato/feedback\">Stackato
  Feedback</a> and <a href=\"http://community.activestate.com/forums/komodo/komodo-beta\">Komodo
  Beta</a> forums.</p>\n</div>\n"
