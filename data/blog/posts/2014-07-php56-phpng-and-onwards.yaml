  PHP is still under active development and there are some very interesting

  changes and features that are coming to the language.


  ## PHP 5.6


  PHP 5.6 is currently in RC (release candidate) status, which means it will be

  officially released soon (I suspect in the next few months).


  Here''s a highlight of the new features:


  * [Constant scalar expressions](http://php.net/manual/en/migration56.new-features.php#migration56.new-features.const-scalar-exprs)

  * [Variadic functions](http://php.net/manual/en/migration56.new-features.php#migration56.new-features.variadics)

  * [Argument unpacking](http://php.net/manual/en/migration56.new-features.php#migration56.new-features.splat)

  * [Namespace use function and use const](http://php.net/manual/en/migration56.new-features.php#migration56.new-features.const-scalar-exprs)

  * [Exponential syntax](http://php.net/manual/en/migration56.new-features.php#migration56.new-features.use)


  We''ve been making changes to Komodo 9 to support PHP 5.6, for code highlighting,

  code intelligence and debugging components. You can get the [Komodo

  9 pre-release](/download/#preview) build from our downloads page.


  ## PHPNG


  A development branch currently being referred to as PHP Next Generation (PHPNG)

  is looking very promising. It''s mostly a refactoring of the PHP (Zend Engine)

  internals, with the aim to increase PHP performance.


  So far, performance has been improved by 100% in real world applications, whilst

  still maintaining API compatibility - that''s totally awesome, and generally

  unheard of in the dynamic languages arena, especially for such a mature language

  like PHP. All in all, amazing improvements and I cannot wait to see the final

  release containing this work!


  This is purely speculation, but I think these PHPNG changes may eventually

  become the center piece for a PHP 6.0 version (maybe next year).


  You can read more about the changes going on in PHPNG here:

  ## PHP 5.3


  It''s also worth looking back at older versions too, as PHP 5.3 is already

  end-of-lifed, with official support ending July 2014 (this month), so no more

  security fixes can be expected for PHP 5.3.
