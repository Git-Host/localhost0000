  \ </p>\n  \n  <p>For programmers, one of the most common questions posed is \"Why
  is my application taking so long?\" For dynamic programming languages, there are
  often limited tools that can answer this important question, or variant questions
  like:</p>\n  \n  <ul style=\"clear:both\">\n  <li>Where is my application spending
  the most CPU time?</li>\n    <li>How many times is this function getting called?</li>\n
  \   <li>By changing X to Y, what performance impact will this have?</li>\n  </ul>\n
  \ <p>With <a href=\"http://docs.activestate.com/komodo/7.0/\">Komodo IDE 7</a> (currently
  Alpha 4 - available at the bottom of the <a href=\"http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide/downloads\">download
  page</a>), Python programmers will now be able to answer these questions using the
  new Code Profiling tools. You can easily launch your application with code profiling
  enabled, and when the application finishes, Komodo IDE will show you a graphical
  representation of the code profiling results. This will allow you to easily see
  exactly where your program spends most of it's time, showing which functions were
  called and which functions called what other functions, how many times they were
  called and how long they took to execute.</p>\n  \n  <p>Armed with this knowledge,
  you'll be able to quickly trace your applications, tweak your code and then re-run
  them, comparing the performance results to your previous runs.</p>\n  \n  <p>Note:
  As of 7.0.0 Alpha 4, Komodo IDE's Code Profiling launcher only supports Python,
  though you can open standalone profiling results that are stored in the <a href=\"http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/cl-format.html\">callgrind
  format</a>, which is a common profiling format used in other dynamic languages.
