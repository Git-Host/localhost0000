:body: ! "\nAfter weeks of hard work we can finally present to you our new web site!
  It's\nbeen a long time coming and although a lot of work has been done thus far
  a lot\nmore is still to come. We're working hard not just on Komodo but also on
  the\ninfrastructure surrounding Komodo: community, addons, support, documentation,
  etc.\n\n<h2 class=\"centered\"><a href=\"#contest\">\"I'm Just here for the contest,
  where do I win stuff?\"</a></h2>\n\n## The New Website\n\n<a href=\"http://docpad.org/\"
  target=\"_blank\" class=\"push-right tooltip\"\n    title=\"The new website is entirely
  powered by DocPad, check them out!\">\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-02/docpad.png\">\n</a>\n\nWhen
  we started work on the new website we knew we wanted to do something different.\nAlthough
  full-fledged CMSes like [Drupal] certainly have their strength they also\ntake away
  a certain amount of flexibility. After a period of evaluation we ultimately\ndecided
  that for the purposes of our Komodo website a static site generator would\ngive
  us the flexibility we desired and give incredible performance to boot. And\nto that
  end we decided [DocPad] would be the best fit for us.\n\nSo why [DocPad]? Why not
  [Jekyll] or one of the huge variety of other [static site generators][generators]\nout
  there? Well first off I don't want to undersell the \"competition\", they all\nbring
  their own unique twist to the table, but since the Komodo code base uses\na lot
  of JavaScript we liked the idea of a [NodeJS] powered static site generator. Aside
  from\nthat simple fact; [Benjamin Lupton][balupton], the creator of [DocPad], has
  done an amazing job\nin making [DocPad] an incredibly versatile tool that can be
  easily modeled to ones\npreferences. Prefer to use [ResText] rather than [Markdown]
  for your blogs? [No problem][restextPlugin]!\nNeed to have some [PHP], [Ruby], [CoffeeScript]
  etc. in your pages? Go for it! It truly is an\namazing tool and so far it's been
  a lot of fun to use.\n\n### There Be Dragons (pun intended)\n\nA big new website
  doesn't come without it's problems, and so there are sure to be\nsome minor issues
  here and there. If you run into any and don't mind sparing a few\nminutes of your
  time, please [report them on github][report].\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nBefore
  I move on to the contest, I'd like to thank [Benjamin Arthur (balupton)][balupton]
  not only\nfor his amazing work on [DocPad] but also for assisting us with some occasional
  issues\nvia [IRC]. Furthermore I'd also like to thank everyone that contributed\nto
  DocPad since it's inception -- Thank you!\n\n<a name=\"contest\"></a>\n## Let's
  Celebrate - Win a Copy of Komodo!\n\nTo celebrate the launch of the new website
