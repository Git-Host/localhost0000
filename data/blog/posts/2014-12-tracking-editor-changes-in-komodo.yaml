:body: ! "\nA change-tracker has been a common item on the Komodo wish-list for about
  as\nlong as there's been a Komodo editor. I had seen this feature in other editors,\nand
  was originally underwhelmed - I wanted to make sure the Komodo track changes\nfeature
  was more useful to developers.\n\nThe first screenshot shows how the tracker margin
  indicates lines with a green\nbar to show additions, red bars to show deletions,
  and blue to show in-place\nchanges.\n\n<img src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-12/track-changes-01.png\"
  alt=\"colored margins show which editor lines have changed\">\n\nNote that these
  margins will include Source Code Control (SCC) changes when the\nfile is under revision
  control. I had originally added preferences to control\nwhether it should show changes
  against the revision control system or just the\nsaved instance on disk, but later
  found these preferences were not really\nneeded. If the document is in SCC, the
  tracker shows changes against the\nrepository, otherwise it shows the unsaved changes
  compared to what is on disk.\n\nWhile we're mentioning colors, you can configure
  which ones are displayed in\nthe margins at *Preferences > Color Schemes > Colors*
  and modify the *Track\nchanges...* values.\n\n<img src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-12/track-changes-colors.png\"
  alt=\"preference colors\">\n\nBut I still didn't find this feature very compelling.
  But then I realized we\nhad a powerful addition to the suite of tools you get by
  using SCC: the ability\nto view and revert individual changes in a document. For
  example, I clicked on\nthe blue margin at line 41 of the document displayed in the
  images. That\ndisplayed a popup panel with the deleted text in red, and the new
  text in\ngreen. I could then press the \"Revert Change\" button to throw away that
  one\nparticular change, but not affect the other changed parts of the documents.
  And\nthis being Komodo 9, I could also share the change via\n<a href=\"http://kopy.io/\">Kopy.io</a>
  with a  single click.\n\n<img src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-12/show-change-03.png\"
  alt=\"showing localized changes\">\n\nAnd what I had previously regarded as a \"checklist
  feature\" has become a tool I\nfind indispensable, in particular when I start working
  on a codebase that's new\nto me. Now when I'm working on unfamiliar code I can deliberately
  do too much\nwork, such as adding soon-to-be superfluous logging statements, de-obfuscation\nof
  code (say breaking one 200-character line of code into 4 clear statements).\nThen
  once my code passes tests, I can now easily revert the blocks of code I no\nlonger
  need, leaving just the (hopefully) small number of changes to check in.\n\nThe next
  screenshot shows what happens after I revert the change block at\nline 41.  If I
  then decide I want to keep it, I can get it back by doing Undo.\n     \n<img src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-12/track-changes-04.png\"
  alt=\"reverting a change\">\n\nAnd with that one addition, this feature went from
  being something I thought\nwould look good in a product review checklist to something
  I use every day.\n\n"
