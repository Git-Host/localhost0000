  as such, please report any problems you run into on our [bug tracker](https://bugs.activestate.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Komodo&version=9.0.0%20preview).\n\n##
  What's New\n\nNote that none of this is final and things will change before the
  final release.\nWe are not yet focussing on UX/UI so be warned.\n\n### Track Changes\n\n<a

  title=\"Track Changes mockup - subject to change\">\n<img src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-06/editor-margins-mockup-thumb.png\"
  align=\"right\">\n</a>\n\nThe editor has gained a new left margin - which highlights
  unsaved changes, as\nwell as any uncommitted SCC changes. Clicking on the margin
  will show a diff\ndialog of the changes - as well as letting you revert individual
  changes! Sweet!\n\n### Python - PEP 8 Syntax Checking\n\nPEP 8 syntax checking has
  been added - you can enable in the Python Syntax\nChecking preferences.\n\nFor those
  that don't know - PEP 8 is the official [Style Guide for Python Code](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).\n\n###
  Performance Tweaks\n\nWe've made a bunch of performance tweaks to Komodo 9 already
  - with more to\nfollow. So far we've been concentrating on two main areas:\n\n*
  *Startup* - we've managed to improve Komodo startup times by around 15%.\n\n* *Editor
  typing speed* - various editing features have been improved, which\n  should be
  most noticeable in larger files, especially HTML/XML.\n\n### Add-on Changes\n\nSome
  of Komodo's add-ons have been made a core part of Komodo - this means that\nthe
  Add-on dialog is a lot less cluttered, and required Komodo Add-ons (here's\nlooking
  at you *Places*) can no longer be disabled.\n\n### Language Changes\n\nThe number
  of primary languages has been reduced (as seen in the language menu\nin the statusbar),
  we've moved the less used languages like (XBL, XUL, Luddite)\ninto the *Other* sub-menu
  - though your free to adjust these in the Komodo\n*Languages* preferences.\n\nMost
  of the core (UDL based) languages (Add-ons) have been moved into the core\npart
  of Komodo (since disabling them has no performance/memory impact, they\nmight as
  well just be hidden).\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n* *Python 3.4* - now supported for
  debugging, etc...\n* *Copy find results* - which can be used via the toolbar in
  the find results widget\n* *Mozilla 31* - Komodo is now built on top of the Mozilla
  31 code base\n* *Analytics* - We now analyze how our users use Komodo to help us
  improve our product.\n  This is entirely optional and we do not track user specific
  information. You\n  can [view our Analytics code on github](https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit/blob/master/src/modules/analytics/content/analytics.js).\n\n##
  Information for Add-on developers\n\nThere are changes that Komodo Add-on developers
  should be aware of - we've\nbeen documenting these major changes on our [Github
  Wiki](https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit/wiki/Komodo-9-Changes).\n\n## Questions?\n\n**Q:**
  When will Komodo 9 be released?<br>\n**A:** We've not set a firm deadline - but
  it will likely around the end of this year.\n\n**Q:** What else is coming in Komodo
  9?<br>\n**A:** We've got a lot planned for Komodo 9, here are some teasers of what
  to expect in\nthe future builds:\n\n* *Code Intelligence improvements* - JavaScript
  ES6 (harmony) support, better\n  (and faster) code intelligence\n\n* *Commando*
  - it's our new *Super Fast Open*, quickly access files, improved\n  search highlighting,
  optimal layouts, custom scope searches, ... you can stop\n  drooling now.\n\n* *Symbol
  Browsing* - you'll be able to search for classes/methods across your\n  entire project,
  not just the current file\n\n* *Lots more* - We don't want to spoil everything ..\n\n**Q:**
  What about Komodo Edit?<br>\n**A:** Komodo Edit builds are not being released yet
  - they will be included later in\nthe preview cycle - as we wanted to start with
  the focus being on Komodo IDE.\n\n**Q:** I have more questions!<br>\n**A:** [Talk
