  day us programmers spend hours upon hours looking at our screen, and the main\nthing
  we look at is not our IDE, it's not our software or our browser; it's our\ncode.
  So it's only natural that our code should be a pleasure to look at. One\nside of
  this is completely in your own hands; writing clean and sensible code.\nThe other
  side slightly less so; the font you choose to represent your code.\n\nThere are
  tons of articles on what is (subjectively) the \"best\" coding font out\nthere,
  but they all seem to focus on the usefullnes of the font, ie. how the font\nfacilitates
  you to write code more efficiently. Whilst this is definitely an\nimportant point
  I feel that what is equally important is the attractiveness of\nthe font, what's
  the point of it being efficient if it's not making you feel\ngood about your code?
  Your font is supposed to make you \"want\" to code, it's\nsupposed to make your
  code look THAT much better. This is what I want to focus\non in this blog; what
  fonts I've tried and enjoyed the most, not (just) because\nof how efficient they
  are, but because of how they made me feel like coding with\nthem.\n\n<a name=\"crossplatform\"></a>\n##
  Cross-Platform Problems\n\nOne of the main issues I've ran into in trying different
  fonts is that they tend\nto \"look\" very different on each platform; this is because
  each platform renders\ntext slightly differently, OSX in particular tends to give
  fonts a bit of a bold\nlook which I personally quite enjoy, but rarely can I use
  the same font on OSX\nand eg. Linux as they simply do not \"feel\" the same. The
  fonts I address here\nI used primarily under OSX and Linux so my take on them might
  be less relevant\nif you are using Windows, you'd have to see for yourself.\n\n<a
  name=\"tweaks\"></a>\n## Tweaks\n\nI've made a few slight tweaks in Komodo that
  help me enjoy writing code more. \nFirst I increased the line height slightly to
  let my code \"breathe\" a little\nmore, you can use the follow code snippet as a
  Macro (trigger it on startup) to\nincrease your line height (modify the amount to
  suit your preference).\n\n```js\nvar editor = komodo.editor;\neditor.styleSetSize(editor.STYLE_BRACEBAD,
  13);\n```\n\nWe will most likely be increasing the line height by default in Komodo
  9.\n\nAnother tweak you might want to look into if you're an OSX user is the\n\"Font
  Quality\" setting under `Preferences > Fonts and Colors > Fonts`, this\nallows you
  to switch between different rendering presets offered by OSX.\n\nSimilarly if you're
  a linux user it's worth playing with your font rendering settings,\nunfortunately
  there is no \"one\" guide that works for every distro, you'll have to\nsearch for
  this yourself.\n\n<a name=\"bestfonts\"></a>\n## The \"Best\" Coding Fonts\n\nAgain
  this is entirely subjective and not an exhaustive list of what is available\nout
  there. I am not trying to give a technical overview of what the font does,\nthere
  are plenty of resources out there for that already. I am simply explaining\nhow
  the font makes me \"feel\" about my code and how that translates into my being\nmore
  efficient.\n\nAll of the screenshots below were taken in Komodo IDE using the [Spacemodo
  color scheme].\n\n<hr>\n<small><a href=\"#top\" class=\"push-right\">Back to Top</a></small>\n\n<a
  name=\"dejavu\"></a>\n### DejaVu Sans Mono\n\n<a href=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-07/dejavusansmono.png\"
  class=\"lightbox-entry\" title=\"DejaVu Sans Mono - Screenshot taken on Elementary
  OS with custom font rendering settings\">\n<img src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-07/dejavusansmono.png\"
  align=\"right\" width=\"400\"/>\n</a>\n\nMy current favourite font is DejaVu Sans
  Mono (on Linux), I was previously using\nSource Code Pro (on OSX - featured below)
  but when switching between Linux I found\nthat it just didn't render consistently,
  after playing around with different fonts\nI found that using DejaVu Sans Mono set
  to \"bold\" mostly gave me the same feel\nas Source Code Pro did on OSX.\n\nWhich
  is to say it made my editor feel a little bit more \"playful\", but not \"too\"\nplayful
  (Comic Sans anyone). I feel something a lot of the programming fonts seem\nto focus
  so much on efficiency that they end up looking very square and dull, which\nis a
  shame.\n\nDejaVu Sans Mono is part of the [DejaVu Fonts] project which is based
  on the\n[Vera Fonts]. *\"Its purpose is to provide a wider range of characters while
  maintaining the original look and feel through the process of collaborative development\"*.\n\n*Website:*

  Source Code Pro\n\n<a href=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-07/sourcecodepro.png\" class=\"lightbox-entry\"
  title=\"Source Code Pro - Screenshot taken on OSX\">\n<img src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-07/sourcecodepro.png\"
  align=\"right\" width=\"400\"/>\n</a>\n\nAs I already mentioned Source Code Pro
  is my OSX counterpart of DejaVu Sans Mono,\nit renders beautifully using the \"Anti-Aliased
  with Smoothing\" `Font Quality`\nsetting. Both fonts work on all platforms, it's
  just that Source Code Pro in my\nopinion works better on OSX and DejaVu Sans Mono
  works better on Linux.\n\nAgain the main thing I love about these fonts is that
  they come across as slightly\nplayful, which you'll see is a recurring theme for
  my most liked fonts.\n\nUnlike DejaVu Sans Mono and some of the other fonts mentioned
  here Source Code\nPro was created specifically with programmers in mind.\n\n*Website:*

  Monaco\n\n<a href=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-07/monaco.png\" class=\"lightbox-entry\"
  title=\"Monaco - Screenshot taken on OSX\">\n<img src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-07/monaco.png\"
  align=\"right\" width=\"400\"/>\n</a>\n\nMonaco is a great font which I used for
  quite a while, it was the default Monospace\nfont for OSX until it was replaced
  by Menlo in 2009. Ultimately I was turned away\nfrom using it because it's a little
  bit \"too\" playful to me.\n\nMonaco comes shipped with OSX and as far as I'm aware
  there are no other legal\nmeans to obtain it, so non-OSX users are out of luck.\n\n<hr>\n<small><a

  Droid Sans Mono\n\n<a href=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-07/droidsansmono.png\" class=\"lightbox-entry\"
  title=\"Droid Sans Mono - Screenshot taken on OSX\">\n<img src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-07/droidsansmono.png\"
  align=\"right\" width=\"400\"/>\n</a>\n\nDroid Sans Mono is an great font which
  to me manages to walk fine line between\nplayful and \"professional\". It feels
  a bit like Monaco (OSX) and Courier (Windows)\nhad a baby. Particularly on OSX it
  looks beautiful. It looks decent on Linux too\nthough I prefer to use it as \"Bold\"
  as it looks too much like Courier and too little\nlike Monaco otherwise.\n\nDroid
  Sans Mono is part of the Droid Fonts and was developed specifically for\nAndroid,
  but has since found its way into many the editors of many programmers.\n\nAlthough
  the font is free and open source there is also a [Pro version available];\n*\"The
  \"Pro\" versions will be in the OpenType format with additional typographic\nfeatures.
  The initial release has Old Style Figures, and more enhancements are\nplanned for
  the future.\"*\n\n*Website:* http://www.droidfonts.com/<br>\n*Download:* https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Droid+Sans+Mono\n\n<hr>\n<small><a

  Ubuntu Sans Mono\n\n<a href=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-07/ubuntusansmono.png\" class=\"lightbox-entry\"
  title=\"Ubuntu Sans Mono - Screenshot taken on Elementary OS with custom font rendering
  settings\">\n<img src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-07/ubuntusansmono.png\" align=\"right\"
  width=\"400\"/>\n</a>\n\nUbuntu Sans Mono is a bit different, it tends to feel more
  condensed and has the\ndistinct slanted design the Ubuntu fonts are \"known\" for.
  I find it a pleasing\ndesign but it feels more appropriate for logo's than for large
  blocks of text or\ncode, it feels like it's trying to prove something rather than
  just \"be a font\".\n\nI had to significantly increase the font size and line spacing
  for the font to\nrender properly for me, after that it was quite enjoyable but in
  the end just\ndoesn't come close to my beloved DejaVu Sans.\n\nI also wasn't able
  to make it render in a way that I liked on OSX because of the\nfont smoothing OSX
  does, obviously this font was designed specifically for Ubuntu\nso it's understandable
  that it was not optimized for other platforms.\n\n*Website:* http://font.ubuntu.com/<br>\n*Download:*

  class=\"lightbox-entry\" title=\"M+ - Screenshot taken on Elementary OS with custom
  font rendering settings\">\n<img src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-07/mplus.png\" align=\"right\"
  width=\"400\"/>\n</a>\n\nFinally there's M+, I bumped into this font the very same
  day I wrote this blog\nthanks to [this blog post written by Tom MacWright][blogpostmplus].
  The font seems to have been\ncreated specifically for programmers as it has several
  variations that each slightly\nalter the way the font looks.\n\nIt's an absolutely
  great font but not entirely up to my tastes; I like how condensed\nit is but it's
  a little bit TOO condensed for my tastes. As I mentioned earlier\nin this blog post
  I like my code to be able to \"breathe\" a little, and while it's\ngreat to be able
  to see a lot of your code on-screen it also makes it a little bit\nchaotic. To be
  fair though, M+ is so clean and stylish it tends to make even the\nmost chaotic
  code look beautiful.\n\n*Website:* http://mplus-fonts.sourceforge.jp<br>\n*Download:*

  Words\n\nSo those are my favourite fonts and how I use them in Komodo. Expect to
  see some\nnew font features in Komodo 9 (I already mentioned line-height). Please
