:body: ! "\nWe've completed the big feature work for Komodo IDE 9, and we'll focus
  on bug\nfixes and polishing for the final release, so please help us out by giving\nKomodo
  9 release candidate a try and report any issues you run into.\n\nWe'll continue
  making nightly releases from here on out, to make it easy for\nKomodo 9 pre-release
  users to keep up to date.\n\nYou can [download the latest Komodo IDE 9 pre-release
  from our Download section](/download#preview).\n\n<div class=\"centered\">\n    <div

  What's New\n\nHere is a list of the major features and product changes made in Komodo
  9 (you\ncan click on the images to enlarge them):\n\n\n### Color Schemes and Themes\n\n<a
  href=\"/assets/images/blog/2015-02/tomorrow-dark-color-scheme.png\" class=\"lightbox\"
  title=\"Tomorrow Dark scheme - click to enlarge\">\n<img src=\"/assets/images/blog/2015-02/tomorrow-dark-color-scheme-thumb.png\"
  align=\"right\">\n</a>\n\nWe've tweaked the Komodo color schemes and we've made
  *Tomorrow_Dark* the new\ndefault Komodo color scheme (a dark-based scheme). All
  Komodo color schemes now\nuse Base16, that is, they are based on a set of 16 different
  base colors, which\nare then re-used in different parts of that scheme.\n\nThe Komodo
  theming has been updated to match the latest operating systems, so\nKomodo now looks
  even better - more akin to other native applications of the OS.\n\nWe also added
  the ability to tweak the editor line height spacing, which is now\nsaved in the
  color scheme preferences page.\n\n\n### Track Changes\n\n<a href=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-12/trackchanges.png\"
  class=\"lightbox\" title=\"Track Changes mockup - click to enlarge\">\n<img src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-12/trackchanges-thumb.png\"
  align=\"right\">\n</a>\n\nThe editor has gained a new left margin - which highlights
  unsaved changes, as\nwell as any uncommitted SCC changes. Clicking on the margin
  will show a diff\ndialog of the changes - as well as letting you revert individual
  changes! Sweet!\n\n<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n\n\n### Markdown Viewer\n\n<a
  href=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-12/markdown-viewer.png\" class=\"lightbox\" title=\"Markdown
  viewer - click to enlarge screenshot\">\n<img src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-12/markdown-viewer-thumb.png\"
  align=\"right\">\n</a>\n\nFor Markdown files, Komodo provides a preview of the generated
  HTML directly\nwithin a Komodo split view and contents will dynamically update itself
  whenever\nyou make a change to the Markdown text - it doesn't even need to be saved.
  You\ncan check out the [markdown blog post] for more details on this feature.\n\n<div
  class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n\n\n### Go Programming Language Support\n\n<img src=\"http://komodoide.com/assets/images/blog/2014-10/golang-logo.png\"
  align=\"right\">\n\nGolang is supported in Komodo. We provide syntax coloring, code
  folding, syntax\nchecking (linting) and code intelligence with completions, calltips,
  outline and\ngoto definition for .go files. Please check out the [golang blog post]
  for more\ndetails on this support.\n\n<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n\n\n### Commando\n\n<a
  href=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-12/commando.png\" class=\"lightbox\" title=\"Commando
  - click to enlarge screenshot\">\n<img src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-12/commando-thumb.png\"
  align=\"right\">\n</a>\n\nThis popup dialog is the combined successor of the *Fast
  Open* and *Invoke Tool*\ndialogs in Komodo 8. Commando provides fuzzy matching,
  match highlighting,\nsearch for files (find any file under a folder), toolbox search,
  bookmark\nintegration, shortcuts (go-tool) integration as well as custom category\nfiltering.\n\n<div
  class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n\n\n### <a href=\"http://kopy.io/\">Kopy.io</a> Helper\n\n<a
  href=\"http://kopy.io/\">\n<img src=\"http://kopy.io/img/pastebin-logo-dark.png\"
  align=\"right\">\n</a>\n\nNow you can easily share (like pastebin) snippets of code
  with other people\ndirectly from Komodo. Simple make a text selection and use the
  editor\nright-click context menu and choose *Share Code via Kopy.io*. Even better
  is that\nKopy.io supports client side encryption, so you can make those shared pastes\nmore
  secure.\n\n<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n\n\n### Notifications UI\n\n<a href=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-12/notify.png\"
  class=\"lightbox\" title=\"Notifications UI - click to enlarge screenshot\">\n<img
  src=\"/assets/images/blog/2014-12/notify-thumb.png\" align=\"right\">\n</a>\n\nNotification
  messages shown to the user now appear in a separate popup panel\nthat overlays the
  main Komodo editor window (previously they appeared in the\nKomodo statusbar). Komodo
  also has notification preferences, allowing you to\ncontrol which messages get displayed
  in the popup panel.\n\n<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n\n\n### Icons\n\nMost of
  the icons in Komodo user interface have been updated to use improved\nimages or
  to use a consistent style. We've tweaked the file icons, language\nicons, places
  icons, toolbox icons, preference page icons and code intelligence\nicons (completions,
  sections list, code browser).\n\n<div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n\n\n### Menu Bar\n\nThe
  Komodo main menu bar (i.e. the File, Edit, ...) is now hidden by default on\nWindows
  and Linux. You can use the Alt key to toggle the menu visibility, or\nforce it be
  always displayed through the *View > Toolbars* menu.\n\nWhilst the top-level menu
  is hidden, a unified menu button will be visible in\nthe top-right of the Komodo
  toolbar, or if the toolbar is also hidden, then it\nwill appear in the Komodo view
  status bar.\n\n\n### PHP 5.6 Support\n\nWe've added support for PHP 5.6, with a
  new Xdebug module (for PHP debugging and\nCode Profiling), updates for keyword changes
  and updates to code intelligence to\nprovide the latest API data for PHP 5.6.\n\n\n###
  Python Updates\n\nPython 3.4 is fully supported for syntax checking, debugging,
  code intelligence,\netc...\n\nWe've added PEP 8 syntax checking - you can enable
  this in the Python Syntax\nChecking preferences. For those that don't know - PEP
  8 is the official [Style\nGuide for Python Code](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).\n\n\n###
  Komodo Developer APIs\n\nWe've been overhauling the Komodo APIs, to make it easier
  to load and access the\nmethods inside of Komodo. We're now making use of CommonJS
  (aka Node.js)\nrequire() calls to load individual modules - you can see the full
  list of\nsupported modules in the Komodo [sdk directory]. Examples of use and more\ninformation
  can be found in the [Komodo wiki].\n\nWe've also added convenient console.log()
  and friends support - the messages\nshow up in the Komodo notifications pane.\n\nThere
  are other changes that Komodo Add-on developers should be aware of - we've\nbeen
  documenting these major changes on our [Komodo wiki] page.\n\n### Performance Tweaks\n\nWe've
  made a bunch of performance tweaks to Komodo 9 already - with more to\nfollow. So
  far we've been concentrating on two main areas:\n\n* *Startup* - we've managed to
  improve Komodo startup times by around 15%.\n\n* *Editor typing speed* - various
  editing features have been improved, which\n  should be most noticeable in larger
  files, especially HTML/XML.\n\n* *Search* - improved performance of find next/previous
  calls\n\n* *Syntax Checking* - Faster syntax checking times\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n*
  *Indentation detection* - better tab v's spaces indentation detection\n* *Statusbar
  moved* - it's now attached to the bottom of the editor view (and\n  not to the bottom
  of the window)\n* *CSS code formatter* - so you can now eaily reformat your CSS
  code\n* *Preferences page* - now has *simple* and *advanced* modes\n* *Startpage*
  - now removed - a Quick Launch page is now displayed when no views are opened\n*
  *Custom workspaces* - can be saved and loaded on demand, use the File > Workspace
  menu\n* *High DPI* - should work correctly on Windows - no blurred fonts\n* *Tab
  width* - the indentation preference has changed from 8 spaces to 4 spaces\n* *Commit
  dialog* - now displays the current branch name\n* *Menus* - various menus were re-organised,
  including tab and editor context menus\n* *Sections list* - has merged with breadcrumbs
  widget\n* *Copy find results* - which can be used via the toolbar in the find results
  widget\n* *File associations* - you can now set file associations for unknown languages\n
  \ hit in the replace in files confirmation dialog\n* *Primary language cleanup*
  - less used languages like (XBL, XUL, Luddite) no\n  longer appear in the main menu
  - though your free to adjust these in the\n  Komodo *Languages* preferences.\n*
  *Komodo Sync* - has been removed for Komodo 9\n* *Mozilla 35* - Komodo is now built
  on top of the Mozilla 35 code base\n* *Analytics* - We now analyze how our users
  use Komodo to help us improve our\n  product. This is entirely optional and we do
  not track user specific\n  information. You can [view our Analytics code on\n  github](https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit/blob/master/src/modules/analytics/content/analytics.js).\n\n##
  Questions?\n\n**Q:** When will Komodo 9 be released?<br>\n**A:** We've not set a
  firm deadline - but it will likely be in the next few months.\n\n**Q:** What else
  is coming in Komodo 9?<br>\n**A:** This is most of the big feature plans we have
  for Komodo 9, we've got a\nfew other things planned, but mostly the focus will be
  on bug fixes and polish\nuntil Komodo 9 final is released. We'll have more features
  coming soon in a\nfollow-up Komodo 9.1 release.\n\n**Q:** I have more questions!<br>\n**A:**
