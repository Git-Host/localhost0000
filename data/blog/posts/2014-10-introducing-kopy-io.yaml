:body: ! "\nToday [we finally launched kopy.io][0] after having had it in soft-launch
  for about 2\nweeks. kopy.io is a new \"service\" for Komodo. Essentially it is a
  pastebin\nalternative with a bunch of little extras you likely wont find in other
  pastebin\nsolutions. Namely you can;\n\n## Create Private Kopies\n\nWhen creating
  a kopy you can set its privacy to \"Client-Side Encryption\", this\nwill encrypt
  your data client-side and send the server the encrypted data. The\nkey needed to
  decrypt the data is never sent to the server and it's up to you\nto decide how/who
  you share this key with. If someone were to access your kopy\nwithout the encryption
  key they'd be met with disappointment.\n\n## Customize It To Your Liking\n\nWe've
  added a bunch of user specific preferences that you can control by pressing\nthe
  preferences button. This will allow you to configure things such as the\nfont size,
  line spacing, color scheme, etc. When you share a kopy with someone\nwho doesn't
  have their own preferences set for kopy.io they will use your\npreferences. So you
  can add some flavour to your kopies.\n\n## Write/Alter Code in a Real Editor\n\nWhen
  you paste or write code on kopy.io you are actually using\n[CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/),
  which will (amongst other things) highlight\nyour code as you type.\n\n## Have kopy.io
  Detect Things For You\n\nBy default kopy.io will resize your kopy's text according
  to the size of the\nkopy in relation to the browser viewport size. Meaning that
  if you share a very\nlarge kopy the text will be smaller, whereas if it is a short
  kopy your text will\nbe larger.\n\nAdditionally kopy.io will attempt to detect what
  language you are using when you\ntype and apply highlighting accordingly.\n\n# Start
  Using kopy.io\n\nThere are a few alternative ways you can paste data onto kopy.io:\n\n##
  Within Komodo\n\nYou can start using kopy.io today by [downloading the addon from
  our Resources section][1].\nKomodo 9 will have support for kopy.io built in.\n\nOnce
  the add-on is installed, Komodo gains an editor context menu where you can\nsend
  a text selection directly to kopy.io.\n\n## Within Shell\n\nYou can use kopy.io
  from your command line with this handy little function:\n\n```bash\nkopy() { a=$(cat);
  curl -X POST -s -d \"raw:$a\" http://kopy.io/documents | awk -F '\"' '{print \"http://kopy.io/\"$4}';
  }\n```\n\nSimply put it in your `.bashrc` and pipe your data to kopy, eg: `echo
  \"hello world\" | kopy`.\n\n# Follow kopy.io\n\nThe easiest way to get notified
  of kopy.io news is by following [the kopy.io twitter\naccount][2]. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kopyio\"
  class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" data-size=\"large\">Follow
  @kopyio</a>\n\n# More Info\n\nFor more information, [check out the kopy.io about
